She “came from the era when you could be considered the sexiest woman in the world without taking your clothes off,” gushed Playboy founder <a href=#>Hugh Hefner</a>.</span></p><p><span>Raquel never believed in her sex symbol image, but she remained forever <a href=#>grateful to the fur bikini</a> she wore in 1966’s </span><i><span>One Million Years B.C.</span></i><span> “It made my whole career,” said the actress, who <a href=#>died on February 15 at age 82</a>. In truth, it was more than just the bikini. In the prehistoric set film, Raquel’s athletic body and windblown mane made elaborately coiffed bombshells like Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth seem positively old-fashioned. “Always be true to yourself, your purpose, your attitude, your feeling,” Raquel said. “And be yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Raised in Southern California by middle class parents — her Bolivian-born dad was an aeronautical engineer — Jo Raquel Tejada was a cheerleader, a beauty pageant queen and graduated high school with honors and a college scholarship. “My father was very tough on me,” recalled the star, who spent her formative years trying to win his approval. “There were times when I disliked him quite a lot, but I wanted to please him.”</span></p><p><span>Teenage love took her in another direction when Raquel wed her high school boyfriend, <strong>James Welch</strong>, in 1959. In just five years, she’d become a divorced <a href=#>mother of two small children</a> working as a model and cocktail waitress to get by. A fortunate meeting with Hollywood agent Patrick Curtis, who would become her second husband, in 1967, helped Raquel break into movies. “To have it said that you’re a sex symbol, the <a href=#>most beautiful girl in the world</a>, is initially terrific,” she admitted. Still, it took time for Raquel to relax into the role. “I felt like I was supposed to be perfect,” she said. “And because everybody was looking at me so hard, I felt there was so much to prove.”</span></p><p><span>The critics never loved her, but Raquel carved out a niche for herself by pivoting from comedy to drama in films and on TV. In her decades on screen, she never filmed a completely nude scene. “I <a href=#>reserve some things for my private life</a>, and they are not for sale,” said the actress.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Inspired by <a href=#>Frank Sinatra</a>, who was a friend, Raquel began singing and dancing in her own Las Vegas nightclub act, in 1973. Eight years later, she took her first bow on Broadway in </span><i><span>Woman of the Year</span></i><span>. “The first minute I stepped out on that stage and the people began applauding, I just knew I’d beaten every bad rap that people had hung on me,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Divorced four times, Raquel often said she never got marriage “right,” but she had no regrets. “I had real feelings for all of them. At the time, I thought it was love and we could make a great life, but it wasn’t in the cards,” said the star, who came to realize that she didn’t need a man. “I like what I do,” she said. “I actually enjoy being me, and I make a good living at it. I’m happy.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46lmK2dXZawtb7ErKpmqpGmwqa4jLCcpZuYqHqiucCzoKefXaq7tbvLnWSsrJ%2Bnxm6y0aikZpyZq7yzr8SdZKanpJ2ys3nTqGSsnaiesrTAjLCmppmeYq6ttdWeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tutankhamun-5-unanswered-questions-egypts-boy-king-died-whats-tomb-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tutankhamun: 5 unanswered questions about Egypt's Boy King - how he died and what's in his tomb">&larr;
