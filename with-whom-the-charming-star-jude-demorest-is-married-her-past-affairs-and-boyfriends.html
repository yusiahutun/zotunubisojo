So, I went in and thought it was going to be another audition, but instead, it was just Lee Daniels in his office. He said, 'Hey Jude, I just wanted to sit with you, one-on-one, spirit to spirit.' That was a trick because I really thought that meant something good."</p><p>The series first aired on 14 December 2016 with the second season premiered on 27 September 2017.</p><p>Besides her major role in the TV series, she also played in Jonas, Hollywood Heights, and Bipolar.
