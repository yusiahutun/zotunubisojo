His conspicuous absence from the mausoleum and the fading prominence of the adulatory terms may indicate a deliberate distancing from past practices of ancestor veneration, according to observers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These changes might be related to the North’s move to avoid mythologising excessively” the leader’s grandfather and father after Kim Jong-un in 2019 warned against such moves that would “shadow the truth”, the ministry official said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is possibly part of Jong-un’s move to wean away from his reliance on his ancestors [to secure legitimacy] or for the North to refrain from evoking idolatrous terms in line with its efforts to project an image of a normal socialist state.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some observers said the younger Kim might have decided that propaganda and demagoguery that unrealistically idolised ancestors would not resonate with the population amid economic hardship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong from the Korea Institute for National Unification said: “Kim has also displayed his will through policies that he would not blindly follow whatever policy directions his ancestors had put in place, and he would cut them off if necessary to pursue his policies.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim’s shift in his strategy towards the South may also be related to the decrease in the use of deifying terms for the ancestors, according to analysts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The previous generations’ United Front unification principle defines the South as an alienated half of the Korean nation that should be liberated from US imperialist rule.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This view contradicts Kim Jong-un’s declaration late last year that characterised inter-Korean ties as those of two separate and hostile countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also ordered the three principles for national reunification, calling for national unity and peace, to be struck off the constitution and a monument dedicated to Kim Il-sung’s wish for reunification in Pyongyang to be dismantled.</p>This change comes as the North Korean leader, emboldened by his consolidation of power since his father’s death in 2011, charts a new course based on nuclear deterrence and stronger ties with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China</span></a> and <a

Political Science Professor Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is an expression of his confidence that the party, the administration and the military are all in his hands,” Yang said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Switzerland</span></a>, and who enjoyed direct access to international news directly without help from his aides, was keenly aware that hero worship was waning globally, he added.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Emeritus Political Science Professor Koh Yu-hwan at Dongguk University warned against “reading too much” into the decrease in the use of terms lionising the two ancestors, noting Kim Jong-un’s legitimacy was underpinned by the narratives surrounding his forebears.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Jong-un can’t claim legitimacy without the halo inherited from his father and grandfather, and it’s hard to believe he can survive without their legacies,” Koh said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Dismissing his ancestors amounts to his own dismissal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The North had to abandon its past United Front tactic, under which it pursued reunification through exchanges and the absorption of a weakened South, as it is now greatly concerned about dominating cultural influences that would intensify through exchanges with the South, Koh said.</p>The past attempts to mend fences with the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">United States</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60

failed.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The North is now seeking to go it alone, groping ways to come to the dialogue table with the United States and Japan without being weighed down by the existence of the South,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0"

Pyongyang</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">North Korea said last month that Japan’s prime minister had offered to meet its leader but stressed that prospects for their countries’ first summit in about 20 years would depend on Tokyo tolerating its weapons programme and ignoring its past abductions of Japanese nationals.</p>Japan acknowledged it had been trying to arrange a bilateral summit but dismissed North Korea’s preconditions for such a meeting as unacceptable, dimming the prospects that Kim and Japanese Prime Minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Fumio Kishida</span></a> would hold a summit any time soon.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Observers say Kim wants improved ties with Japan as a way to drive a wedge between the US and its allies, while Kishida wants to use possible progress in the abduction issue, a highly emotional matter for Japan, to boost his declining approval rating at home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After admitting in 2002 that it had abducted 13 Japanese nationals, North Korea allowed five to return home but said the others had died. Japan believes some are still alive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Associated Press</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JqhnSClGilqKqknXqsu9GemKxlm566brbOp55mrZ5isLDBy51knKCRp8Fuu9anZKKclaS5sLPInJilZaCWwal5wpqjnK2clsGmsIympq%2BdXZbEosWMopuopJmotq%2BzjJ%2Bmq52Smq6zvw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hvnpshcfwpxwseup43tmincjcrfulcke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV">&larr;
