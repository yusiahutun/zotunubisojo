raped and murdered 9-year-old Skyler Kauffman</p><p><span>The agreement enables James Lee Troutman to avoid the death penalty for the strangling and sexual assault on nine-year-old Skyler Kauffman at the apartment complex in Souderton, where a previous encounter between them prompted a call to the police.</span></p><p><span>Facing a judge today, Troutman pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and related charges.<br></span></p><p><span>He admitted he raped Kauffman, then choked her and slammed her head against the basement floor repeatedly before dumping her body in a trash bin on May 9.</span></p><p><span>That was a few weeks after the little girl’s mother called police on April 18 to complain about Troutman after </span><span>her daughter and a friend said Troutman had locked them in his apartment, and only let them go when they started screaming.</span></p><p><span>But police said they could not charge him due to lack of evidence.</span></p><p><span>Defense attorney Craig Penglase said that his client had wanted to plead guilty all along, but he was trying to avoid the death penalty.</span></p><p><span>'I applaud the DA's office for their decision to make that possible,' Penglase told the Bucks County Courier Times.<br></span></p><p><span>He added: 'Without their proper use of discretion to take death off the table, this plea wouldn't have happened and all parties would have had to go through a trial.'</span></p><p><span>Investigators became suspicious of Troutman, now 25, after noticing blood on his sneakers, and he eventually confessed, telling authorities: 'It was like white-out' and he 'snapped'.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/11/article-1385814-0C012F4D00000578-22_306x423.jpg
