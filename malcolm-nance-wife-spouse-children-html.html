During his media career, he criticized the American President since the time of the election, which became the gateway for the death threats against his family.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Still, he stood against death threats and fought against the false accusation to be the member of ISIS member. And it all happened in times when he was going through the miserable family time as his spouse was diagnosed with cancer.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Criticizing&nbsp;President Donald Trump Triggers Death Threats</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The retired Navy intelligence officer, Malcolm Nance had a family to return when he was in the national security from the year 1981 to 2001. With his tremendous work and act of counterterrorism intelligence, death threats were given to his family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Related to "Counterterrorism expert":-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Retired FBI Philip Mudd Bio Unfolds: Age, Married Status, Wife & Family Details</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Even after his life-worth of service to the nation, he was rumored to be a member of ISIS. He is also the eyewitness&nbsp;of 9/11 attack where the American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the Pentagon tower.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was given a threat by some anonymous people&nbsp;to rape his wife and daughter blaming him for being the member of the ISIS group. He took to Twitter on 28 April 2018 with the shocking revelation of the threats. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Malcolm Nance announces the death threats given to his family</strong> (Photo: Malcolm Nance's Twitter)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The death threats&nbsp;were based&nbsp;on the report&nbsp;from Breitbart editor Alex Marlow that claimed Malcolm had called for a terrorist attack on the Trump Tower in Turkey. For the illegible activity of the Alex, he lost his glorious year&nbsp;of self-respect which he had earned by hunting the terrorist for decades. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>He disgracefully asked the editor to provide the evidence which proved him to be the terrorist.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Show me the story. And if the story is as you describe it, I’ll be happy to offer an apology.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>He further claimed that the followers of the article threatened his family, children, and wife&nbsp;by believing in the story presented by the editor. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>The MSNBC&nbsp;“counter-terrorism analyst,”&nbsp;Malcolm is the criticizer of President Donald Trump since his run to the presidential election and also had denoted him with ISIS candidate.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>See Also:-</strong><a href=# rel=follow><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Government Watchdog Jonathan Karl: His Journalism Career in ABC News, Married Life, and his Wife</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Well, it seemed&nbsp;due to his despise nature for the US President, he was blamed for bombing&nbsp;Donald Trump's property. Following the denotation of the terrorist advocacy, he took to Twitter on 18 April 2017 with the humorous tweet which said that another property of Trump will be his next nominee for the ISIS suicide bombing.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt height=15 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" title="Click and drag to move" width=15 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Malcolm Nance humorous tweet about ISIS</strong> (Photo: Malcolm Nance's Twitter)</p><p style=text-align:justify>With this now-deleted post of Malcolm, the Turkish president removed&nbsp;Trump's name from the building owned by a&nbsp;Turkish conglomerate.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Basically, Newsbusters and Breitbart decided to assume that Nance, who has fought against terrorist like ISIS for the last three decades would call for a&nbsp;terrorist attack simply because the target had a&nbsp;connection to Trump, rather than giving his professional assessment of what might be the next likely ISIS target. &nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Family Business, Personal Life; Cancer Victim Wife Adopts Children&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Born and raised in Philadelphia, Malcolm hailed from the old U.S military family, where his&nbsp;great-great-grandfather was the first person to serve in the US' Civil War, and then his parents including his brother were in the US army.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But he transitioned from the&nbsp;U.S. Army to the U.S. Navy,&nbsp;starting the&nbsp;family legacy of Army and Navy service.
