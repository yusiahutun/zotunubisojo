They&nbsp;explore female&nbsp;interests and issues, often walking a tightrope between stating facts and stereotyping.</p><p><strong>Here are our top picks of women-friendly websites.</strong> Men are welcome to join the conversation.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=work-and-money>Work and Money</h2><p>Women are stepping into the role of the breadwinner just as often as men and are fulfilling it just as well. They're not only ambitious about their careers, they're also getting savvy about their finances.</p><h3 id=levo>Levo</h3><p>If you want to <strong>be part of a positive network</strong> that can help you fulfill your career aspirations, Levo is the place to be.</p><p>You'll find personalized tools on the site to build your career from the ground up. Get easy access to the best job opportunities, mentors, and fellow professionals. Articles, interviews, guides, Q&As —&nbsp;the site has everything!</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/levo-mentors-640x340.jpg><p>Expand your reach further by joining one of the local chapters Levo has in various cities across the world.</p><h3 id=dailyworth><a href=#>DailyWorth</a></h3><p>DailyWorth gives you the know-how to gain financial independence, manage your money, and deal with financial crises. It&nbsp;also covers topics like career, travel, relationships, and culture. The site aims to help you lose the money-related fears you might be&nbsp;carrying around as a result of familial or societal conditioning.</p><p>The important thing is that&nbsp;DailyWorth places <strong>self-worth ahead of net worth</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=tech-and-culture>Tech and Culture</h2><p>Tech and culture are entrenched in our day-to-day our life. Here are four websites that look at&nbsp;various aspects of it.</p><h3 id=women-2-0><a href=#>Women 2.0</a></h3><p>Women 2.0 highlights the work of female entrepreneurs in tech and helps aspiring ones move forward with confidence. It's welcoming of men in its network-building activities and events.</p><p>The platform seeks to help more women step into the roles of innovators and leaders by giving them the resources they need. Think meetups, annual conferences, competitions, and regular Hangouts with investors.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/women-2.0-640x360.jpg><p>Remember, you also get a steady stream of helpful articles on Women 2.0. They cover everything from startup costs to developer tools to maternity leave.</p><h3 id=brain-pickings><a href=#>Brain Pickings</a></h3><p>Brain Pickings is a super successful blog curated by writer Maria Popova. It delves into the intricacies of art, science, history, and culture —&nbsp;all in the quest to decipher "what makes a good life".</p><p>This website is <strong>not just for women</strong>, but it's&nbsp;just too brilliant to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;out of this list.</p><h3 id=paper-droids><a href=#>Paper Droids</a></h3><p>Paper Droids is an online magazine for women geeks. It publishes content on science, technology, art, literature, and entertainment.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Regardless of the type of geek you are, you're sure to find something of interest on Paper Droids. Hardcore gaming, literary criticism, indie comics, and blockbuster movies are some of the topics you'll find on the site.</p><p><a href=#>The Mary Sue</a> is another site that focuses on women geeks, and has branded itself as <strong>"a guide to geek girl culture"</strong>. Much like Jezebel, it draws polarizing reactions, so it's hard to tell if it's something you'll like or not.</p><p><strong>On a side note</strong>, we could certainly do with more mainstream websites where <a href=#>women can get their geek on</a> in peace.</p><h3 id=pop-sugar><a href=#>Pop Sugar</a></h3><p>Lifestyle, entertainment, pop culture, tech, fitness, food, fashion, love, beauty —&nbsp;PopSugar delivers it all. Clear categorisation on the site makes it easy to find topics that are of interest to you.</p><h2 id=self-worth>Self Worth</h2><p>High self-worth is a different (and the best!) kind of beautiful. We'll get to the websites that help you shine on the outside, but first, let's focus on the ones that show you how to tend to your inner beauty.</p><h3 id=gala-darling><a href=#>Gala Darling</a></h3><p>Gala Darling has made it her life's <strong>mission to help women fall in love themselves</strong>. She urges her readers to <a href=#>practice radical self love</a>. It refers to&nbsp;unlearning negative concepts related to self image and accepting&nbsp;one's self.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>And yes, Darling&nbsp;leads by example. Her own practice of radical self love shines through in her unapologetic writing and presence.</p><h3 id=everyday-feminism><a href=#>Everyday Feminism</a></h3><p>Everyday Feminism champions the cause of equality for every individual. It takes a stand against discrimination and marginalization of people based on any type of social disparity.</p><p>The site works to <strong>help women reclaim their lives</strong> and take better care of themselves in every way. Everyday Feminism also has a couple of courses to help women build healthier relationships with themselves and with others.</p><p>Begin with the site's Fem 101 category and work your way through the others like Self Worth, Gender, Body, Love, Race, and Violence. You'll find everything from explanations of <a href=#>cultural phenomena like mansplaining</a> to discussions on transgender issues and sexual trauma.</p><h3 id=hellogiggles><a href=#>HelloGiggles</a></h3><p>HelloGiggles&nbsp;is a fun&nbsp;community for the modern young woman. It explores news, pop culture, careers, style, etc. with a humorous&nbsp;and intelligent&nbsp;approach.</p><p>What's encouraging to see is that the site keeps negativity out of the picture without glossing over important issues. Have you visited their Kindness Uncovered archives yet?</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=beauty-and-style>Beauty and Style</h2><p>Websites that showcase the latest in fashion make great eye candy. But you won't always&nbsp;find&nbsp;<strong>practical advice that's lifestyle appropriate and pocket friendly</strong> on such websites. For that, the following websites are much better. They're powered by women who're easier to relate to.</p><h3 id=wardrobe-oxygen><a href=#>Wardrobe Oxygen</a></h3><p>Wardrobe Oxygen has been around for a decade now, and is still going strong. If you're a woman over 30, Alison Gary's blog is for you! She helps you express your personal style through your wardrobe regardless of your working budget.</p><p>You'll find outfits categorised by season, capsule wardrobe suggestions, and beauty tips. If you want to get your style queries answered, there's an <strong>Ask Allie</strong> feature. There's also a <strong>What I wore</strong> section where Alison shows off her outfits and shares links to help you recreate it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/alisons-outfit.jpg><p>The blog not only highlights the importance of picking quality over quantity, but also teaches you how you can find quality at any price point.</p><h3 id=penny-chic>Penny Chic</h3><p>Shauna, the woman behind Penny Chic, has spent enough time in the fashion world to know what goes into dressing well. But what she's intent on proving is that you can get all the chic you want while staying within your means.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/penny-chic-640x480.jpg><p>From shopping tips to outfit ideas, you'll find a little bit of everything on the website. Everyday women who make up Team Penny Chic model the ensembles.</p><h3 id=15-minute-beauty-fanatic><a href=#>15 Minute Beauty Fanatic</a></h3><p>The name of the website says it all. 15 Minute Beauty Fanatic brings beauty tips and products for busy women. Hair care, skin care, makeup —&nbsp;you'll find information on all of it. (If you want to experiment with a new look, try these <a class=no-callout href=#>apps for a virtual makeover</a>.)</p><p>The Skin 101 and Hair 101 sections are good places to start exploring the website. Hop over to the <strong>Get the Look</strong>&nbsp;section for <strong>Mommy Fast Friday</strong>. It's a series in which beauty bloggers who are mothers share their 5-10-15-minute beauty routines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mommy-fast-friday-640x480.jpg><h2 id=homekeeping>Homekeeping</h2><p>Even if you share or delegate responsibilities, keeping your home beautiful and running efficiently is no small task. You need all the smart tips and tweaks you can get your hands on.</p><h3 id=apartment-therapy><a href=#>Apartment Therapy</a></h3><p>If you want to find the best ways to <strong>improve your living space</strong>, look no further than Apartment Therapy. Its focus is on inspiring you to create a healthy and beautiful home in an affordable manner,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it gives you the right resources to accomplish that.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The folks at Apartment Therapy recommend a sensible, work-with-what-you-have approach. They prove that good design is accessible to all and home improvement projects need not be expensive.</p><p>You can filter content based on room type, project type, decor style, lifestyle, etc. Be sure to join Apartment Therapy's thriving community scene.

Add new little humans to the mix and things are bound to get a lot more hectic. The good news is that <strong>parents can seek out a bit of handholding online</strong> as they navigate the tricky terrain of parenthood.</p><h3 id=mumsnet><a href=#>Mumsnet</a></h3><p>Mumsnet is a thriving, UK-based online community that tackles different areas of life from the perspective of a parent. It started out as an information-sharing resource for mothers.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>On various occasions, the site&nbsp;has been in the news for the wrong reasons. This is due to what many see as Mumsnet's unhealthy, competitive approach to motherhood. But, there are many who think otherwise and for whom the site is a daily lifeline of sorts. We'll leave it up to you to decide whether Mumsnet is a good, reliable resource for you to consider.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mumsnet-640x480.jpg><p>Keep an eye out for the handy set of tools in the footer. It includes an ovulation calculator, a pregnancy calendar, and a baby name finder.</p><h3 id=the-longest-shortest-time><a href=#>The Longest Shortest Time</a></h3><p>Hillary Frank's difficult start to motherhood led her to start The Longest Shortest Time. It's <strong>a refreshing, tell-it-like-it-is podcast</strong>&nbsp;and website on parenting.</p><p>For expecting and new parents, the reality of daily living can be far different from what popular books and other media portray. Sure, there's cuteness and laughter, but, there are dark times too. The Longest Shortest Time guides moms and dads through the latter by helping them see that they're not alone.</p><p>If you had to choose just one parenting website to keep up with, we'd recommend this one! And to know how the podcast got its name, read about <a href=#>the experience that started it all</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Non-parents</strong>, the site is worth your time as well.</p><h2 id=life-hacking>Life Hacking</h2><p>Want find your calling?
