Witnesses had also had to be flown over from Belfast for the case.</p><p>After the judge's decision Miss Chinner told the court: "In light of the fact that the Crown are not in a position to conduct any meaningful cross-examination of either of the two doctors because the Crown cannot instruct their own experts to deal with the suggestions in this document it seems that there is no realistic prospect of a conviction and for that reason I intend to offer no evidence."</p><p>Mr McMenamin, who appeared in court today wearing a smart dark blue pinstripe suit and striped black and grey tie, has appeared in numerous television and film roles.</p><p>They include a TV adaptation of David Copperfield and the film To End All Wars alongside Robert Carlyle, Kiefer Sutherland and Long Firm star Mark Strong.</p><p><strong>Delighted</strong></p><p>Outside court, Mr Hayes said: "Mr McMenamin is absolutely delighted that justice has been done and he leaves this court without any stain on his character.</p><p>"Also, he can get on with his life and earn some money."</p><p>He added that he hoped air crews would in future be trained to spot the difference between those suffering from a panic attack and those who were drunk.</p><p><strong>Panic</strong></p><p>The actor had fallen asleep on board the flight and woken up "confused" Mr Hayes said.</p><p>"He was abusive to some of the air crew but it wasn't deliberate," he added.</p><p>"I suspect he will be more careful next time he travels by air."</p><p>Mr McMenamin said: "It is quite a common syndrome. There are various types of panic disorder.</p><p>"You wake up in a confused state and don't know where you are. It is something that happens to me every couple of months."</p><p>He still faces a summary charge of threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour but Mr Hayes said he would be "very surprised" if prosecutors now pressed ahead with the allegations, which would be heard at a magistrates' court.</p><p>Reacting to today's result the actor said: "I am delighted. It's been hanging over me for a while. Now I can just get on with my life, hopefully."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmpqaGdrgnCcwKegnGWRqcGir8pmmJysn6d6pLjEmqmenF6dwa64</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-amy-grant-bike-accident-recovery-updates.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Amy Grant?
