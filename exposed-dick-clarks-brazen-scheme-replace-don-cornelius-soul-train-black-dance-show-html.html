If Dick Clark had been allowed to do it, then there would have been no Don Cornelius’, the author quotes Avant.</p></span><p><span>Avant received a threatening letter from William Morris Agency that represented Dick Clark Productions telling him to stay out of their business.

Stevie was one of many black superstar entertainers that performed on Soul Train.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>He had the vision that black music and dancing would be captivating on TV and he was presenting black people in a positive way, showcasing very sexy, young African Americans dancing to the latest R&B, funk, jazz, disco and gospel music.</span></p><p><span>‘The key ingredient for the success of Soul Train was that it’s very solidly based on black music’, Cornelius told the author before his suicide in 2012.</span></p><p><span>‘These were the best dance records made for our beginning period, our second decade, our third decade and any future decades. The best dance records made during those periods were black records. Made by black artists, black singers, black musicians. The best dance music was our folks. We just played the best dance records possible’.<br></span></p><p><span>Michael Jackson never appeared on the show, but he copied a backsliding dance that was performed on Soul Train by the Electric Boogaloos and Michael dubbed it the moonwalk. When Jackson appearance on NBC’s broadcast of Motown 25, a celebration of Barry Gordy’s label in 1983, he did what is actually the backslide.</span></p><p><span>That dance had debuted on Soul Train in 1979.<br></span></p><span></span><span><img id=i-a7150e55 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/20/article-2585503-1C72A61100000578-283_634x433.jpg height=433 width=634 alt="Say what?

Years before Michael Jackson did his 'moonwalk', the Electric Boogaloos performed the backslide on a Soul Train episode</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;‘What they call the moonwalk is not the moonwalk’, Electric Boogaloo member Robot Dane said. ‘It’s the backslide. The moonwalk actually looks like you’re walking on the moon, like Marcel Marceau…Backsliding is you’re going backwards.’<br></span></p><p><span>The best black artists wanted to be on the pulsating “Sooooooollllll Train! James Brown, the Godfather of soul came on making the show a crucial stop for established stars.<br></span></p><p><span>Barry White followed, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Jermaine Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, the Spinners…even Elton John and David Bowie asked to be on the hottest and sexiest dance show on television.</span></p><p><span>What went on behind the scenes of the Saturday morning show that Cornelius considered a black American Bandstand was so hot, recording artists asked to be on the show so they could get close to the dancers. It was the hypersexual atmosphere of Los Angeles in the 1970s and ‘80s.</span></p><p><span>Smokey Robinson was reportedly so hot for one Soul Train dancer, she inspired him to write ‘The Agony and the Ecstasy,’ and Marvin Gay wrote his album I Want You inspired by a seventeen-year-old dancer named Jan he would later marry.</span></p><p><span>Cornelius tried to discourage the barely legal female dancers from hooking up with singers and musicians they met on the show. He didn’t want Soul Train to be considered a home base for groupies or a hookup spot. But he had a hard time enforcing it.<br></span></p><p><span>A number of dancers on the show were gay and Cornelius just accepted it. So black gay culture had a platform and Soul Train introduced gay culture to the masses.</span></p><p><span>Dancer Jody Watley told the author: ‘Soul Train had an obvious black male gay culture going on, and for that reason the show was also quite forward. Don allowed everyone to be themselves on camera’.<br></span></p><span></span><span><img id=i-a82e0e66 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/21/article-2585503-1C7345C200000578-729_634x492.jpg height=492 width=634 alt="Gay pride: Platform shoes, applejack caps, Afro hairdos--Soul Train was a trendy show and gay dancers were common.

Rosie was viewed as being aggressive and sexy, ‘like a machine gun.’ Other dancers were intimidated at first and weren’t initially kind.<br></span></p><p><span>'Don Cornelius did not want to see how I really danced’, said Perez. ‘I was doing hip-hop, and it was foreign to people out in California. They only knew about popping and locking, so they were not keen on hip-hop dancing.</span></p><p><span>‘Then I had to dance in high heels, and I never danced in high heels before, and I had this little tiny short dress, and it’s riding up my ass and I’m like, Oh my God. I couldn’t move.</span></p><p><span>‘The first couple of times, I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. I was just excited and nervous and scared and just elated. That was my style.

I was hot’.</span></p><p><span>Cornelius wanted Rosie to join a female vocal trio he was putting together and sign a contract. She refused even after he took her out to dinner. She didn’t dance again on the show but a lucky break came for her when she was visiting the show and dancing by herself in the corner. She was spotted by record company executive from MCA and signed a choreography contract to teach singers how to dance.</span></p><p><span>‘That was the beginning of my choreography career’, Rosie says. ‘That’s how it all started. It started from Soul Train’.</span></p><p><span>Grammy winning singer/songwriter Jody Watley began as a Soul Train dancer. When her family moved out to Los Angeles, she was fourteen and desperate to get on the show. When she finally made it, she became a celebrity and made fun of at school for the outfits that she wore.<br></span></p><span></span><span><img id=i-a7840e5e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/20/article-2585503-1C72A61500000578-344_634x395.jpg height=395 width=634 alt="Coming up Rosie: Rosie Perez got her start as a dancer on Soul Train when she was 19.

You’re not afraid to be who you really are’. She was on the show for three years and auditioned for a record label – which set her major recording career in motion.<br></span></p><p><span>Nick Cannon,&nbsp; now married to Mariah Carey stated he came out of the womb watching Soul Train. He danced on the show and would return as performer. It was the thrill of a lifetime, he says.<br></span></p><p><span>In the early 1980s, Don Cornelius was diagnosed with a congenital malformation of the blood vessels in his brain, a life-threatening condition. He underwent a twenty-one hour operation in November, 1982. He was back at work six months later. In 2001, he had married Viktoria Chapman, a statuesque Russian blonde who flaunted her deep cleavage. She was a former Miss Ukraine who had modeled in Russia before hooking up with Don.<br></span></p><p><span>By 2006, Cornelius wanted out of the business and he called Avant. He knew the music scene had moved on.

Cornelius sold Soul Train in the spring of 2008. He was 71 and a very rich man.</span></p><p><span>Chapman filed for divorce in 2007 and while the couple were estranged, she pepper sprayed Cornelius after heated arguments in 2008 at their Mulholland Drive house and she took out restraining orders on him.</span></p><p><span>He was formally charged with spousal abuse and placed on 36-month probation. The divorce was final in May 2009 and he was ordered to pay her $10,000 a month in spousal support, buy her a home not to exceed $1,095,000, and pay tuition fees for her daughter adopted by Cornelius.<br></span></p><p><span>When Don grew despondent several years later, friends suggested it was due to a cancer scare. On February 2, 2012, he was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was seventy-five.<br></span></p><p><span>Since late in 2012, Magic Johnson has become a spokesman for the Soul Train brand and is trying to launch a new weekly show and produce a biographical film on Cornelius.<br></span></p><p><span>When Don Cornelius first landed a job at Chicago’s WVON as a news reader and street reporter, he covered the civil rights movement with Dr. Martin Luther King and the riots in 1968.
