Read on to find out why.</strong></p><p>American actor, comedian, rapper, Tv host, and entrepreneur Nick Cannon has lived a career worthy of emulation in Hollywood. The Californian native rose to fame as a teenager in the 1990s when he became a regular on the Nickelodeon network.</p><p>He made his Tv debut on the show “All That” in 1995. The young actor also co-hosted the “All That Music Festival and More Tour,” “Snick House,” and “TEENick in Concert.”</p><p>Before long, Cannon became the youngest ever writer on the network, working on shows like “Kenan and Kell” in 1996 and “Cousin Skeeter” in 1998. Finally, in 2002 the actor started his self-titled show “Nick Cannon Show.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/28/b1/fc/28b1fc9f7aa1b94f858d9e6df76cd611.jpg><p>Cannon <a href=#>crossed</a> over from Tv to Movies in 2002 when he starred in the movie “Men in Black II.” A year later, he got his first lead role in the film “Drumline” and then “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” in 2003.</p><p>In “Love Don’t Cost a Thing,” Cannon starred opposite actress Christina Milian and their performance received praises from critics. However, most did not know that Cannon and Milian’s chemistry had spilled from the screen into real life.</p><p>Like Cannon, Milian was also a multitalented entertainer. She <a href=#>starred</a> in “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” as one of the fast-rising stars in Hollywood. She made her debut during the 90s and appeared on the Disney Tv show “Movie Surfers.” In addition, Milian had minor roles in series like “Charmed and Clueless” and American Pie in 1999.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In 2000 she branched into music by performing singing vocals on rapper Ja Rule’s album “Rule 3:36.” Milian also co-wrote the hit song “Play” for Jennifer Lopez’s album “J.Lo,” and in 2001, she released a self-titled album.</p><p>Although Cannon initially denied news reports the two had become an item, they could not keep their romance a secret for long. With their looks and profiles, Cannon and Milian looked perfect together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nick_Cannon_and_Christina_Milians_Relationship></span><strong>Nick Cannon and Christina Milian’s Relationship</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cannon and Milian fell in love on set while co-starring in the 2003 film “Love Don’t Cost a Thing.” Although Cannon had tried to date Milian before they starred together, the actress refused his advances.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-pinterest wp-block-embed-pinterest"></figure><p>However, their relationship <a href=#>blossomed</a> while filming, and they subsequently started dating. Miliana and Cannon became one of Hollywood’s hottest couples, to the delight of many fans. Sadly their relationship did not last very long, and they called it quits just two years into their romance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_They_Broke_Up></span><strong>Why They Broke Up</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although neither party confirmed<strong> </strong>they<strong> </strong>had broken up, it became clear as the pair drifted apart. However, Cannon and Milian also remained on friendly terms afterward.</p><p>However, in 2019, Milian decided to spill the beans on what caused their breakup and address what fans had long suspected. The actress dropped a jaw-dropper while appearing on E! News’ “Just the Sip” digital series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Milian revealed she suspected Cannon was cheating on her towards the end of their relationship. She <a href=#>revealed</a>:</p><p><strong>“When I was dating Nick Cannon, the password somehow worked on the first check, and I was right and the next thing you know, I was reading for like a month. After that, I was reading messages.”</strong></p><p>The Actress said she was in Romania and had enough time to go through everything. However, she could not confront Cannon until she returned to the United States. Instead, Milian used the time to gather enough undeniable intel about his cheating escapades.</p><p>&nbsp;Milian waited for a month before confronting Cannon, and she was heartbroken because the actor was her first love. The actress could not believe Cannon, who was also living at her house, would do such a thing to her.</p><p>Shortly after Milian’s revelations, Cannon also addressed their breakup issues with some eye-raising comments. While appearing on the Power 106 radio show, the actor explained he did not do anything wrong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>According to him, they were never officially together in the first place.&nbsp; Cannon <a href=#>declared</a>:</p><p><strong>“I don’t think I did anything wrong. I wasn’t cheating. You’ve got to be in a relationship to cheat. She went through my phone and all that, and back then, I told her, and I will tell her now if you go looking for something, you’re going to find something.”</strong></p><p>Without getting into many details, the actor explained that he was careless enough to get caught cheating because he never really cared.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cannon_Doesnt_Believe_in_Monogamy></span><strong>Cannon Doesn’t Believe in Monogamy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Milian has moved on with other people since Cannon broke her heart. The actress is now married to her husband, French singer Matt Pokora. They <a href=#>exchanged </a>marital vows in December 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cannon recently became a father for the seventh time. The actor’s longest relationship is his six years of marriage to Mariah Carey. Over the years, the actor has fathered kids with multiple women.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Fans and peers have criticized Cannon for having kids with different women, and he finally addressed the issue while appearing on “The Breakfast Show.” After the show host, Charlamagne Tha God, inquired about why he has kids with many women, Cannon replied that he was surprised why people questioned that.</p><p>The father of seven <a href=#>declared</a> that he does not accept the idea that you’re supposed to be with one person for the rest of your life. Cannon explained that such belief meant you classify your partner as property, and he doesn’t believe it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ku6qvymaamqaepLturc2dZJygop7AtbXNmmSmoZyerq95wGaroqWVobavsYyonWasmJq2s3nRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./angela-bassett-red-carpet-oscars-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angela Bassett Wore a Vibrant Purple Gown on the 2023 Oscars Red Carpet">&larr;
