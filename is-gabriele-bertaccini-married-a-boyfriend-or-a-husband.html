Obviously, fans then started asking questions about his love life — if he’s married? Or does he have a boyfriend?</span></p><p><span>Thus, here we are with answers to all these queries relating to Gabriele’s love life.</span></p><h3><b>Is Gabriele Bertaccini Married? Is He With A Boyfriend Or A Husband?</b></h3><p><span>No, Gabriele Bertaccini didn’t seem to be married. However, he was enjoying the dating game, and many believed Reece Carter could be his boyfriend.</span></p><p><span>Gabriele and Reece were indeed close in 2017. The two were often spotted out vacationing and Gabriele often shared their lovely pics on IG. Over one of the posts, he hinted, “Forty-five minutes late and he still manages to smile. I must be THAT charming!”</span></p><p><span>His alleged boyfriend, Reece Carter is a model, an online sensation, and a nutritionist. He first came to the limelight in Jan 2012 as one of the first people to start posting content on Instagram related to fitness and modeling. Later, he gained more traction after writing the book </span><i><span>The Lifestyle Suite</span></i><span>, which discusses various eating habits and diets.</span></p><p><span>In September 2022, he also released another book called </span><i><span>The Girl, the Ghost, and the Lost Name</span></i><span> — a spooky, funny, magical, and atmospheric adventure with a compelling hero.</span></p><p><span>Find Reece on IG @</span><a href=#><span>herbnerdreece</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Now, coming back to Gabriele, though he might be enjoying the dating game, he has to be careful with his partners because he’s HIV-positive! Yes, unlike many, Gabriele’s vocal about his disease in hopes that he could inspire others who may be dealing with HIV to be open and honest.</span></p><p><span>The chef first opened up to the world he tested HIV-positive in an episode of </span><i><span>Say I Do back</span></i><span> in 2020. “When you surround yourself with people who are vulnerable — and they are not afraid of sharing their story — the best thing you can do is really show them vulnerability back. And that’s kind of what happened that day when we were filming,” he said.</span></p><p><span>“I’m so thankful that the support I had was one that allowed me to move forward in a healthy way that made me understand this wasn’t something that marked me and made me less than what I was before,” he added. “We have to make sure this support…is available for everyone who goes through that.”</span></p><p><span>Well, his courage indeed paid off as the many dared to come out to their close ones after Gabriele’s emotional reveal. A letter he received from a fan read, “I tested positive for HIV two weeks ago. I am sitting here with my mom, and I started crying because I don’t have the courage to tell her. I hope one day I will.”</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Gabriele Bertaccini Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Gabriele Bertaccini flaunted a net worth of above $2 million in 2023. He is the owner of </span><i><span>iL TOCCO FOOD & CULINARY MISCHIEF</span></i><span> which provides exclusive dining experiences with Culinary Events, Underground Roving Food, and Wine Occasions.</span></p><p><span>“We assist our clients in the creation of their culinary dream events all over the globe including Phoenix, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Milan, and Florence. We are proud to offer one of the most unique business concepts and culinary EVENT experiences ever created,” Gabriele said.</span></p><p><span>But Gabriele’s not only a chef, he also worked as a Culinary Writer for </span><i><span>Arcadia News-Leader</span></i><span> back in Jan 2010. Two and a half years later, he then joined </span><i><span>Green Living AZ </span></i><span>magazine as a Food Columnist. Meanwhile, he was also working as the Director of U.S. Market and Sales at </span><i><span>Tuscan Country Roads</span></i><span>, a Premier Travel Agency and Tour Operator for Luxury Italian Travel. Quitting his job as a Food Columnist just six months later, Gabriele continued working for the tour company and was still employed there as of 2023.</span></p><p><span>He also was working as a Director of U.S. Relations for </span><i><span>American Dream Tour Operator</span></i><span> for over 13 years in 2023.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, he studied Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc), Logistics, Materials, and Supply Chain Management at </span><i><span>W. P. Carey School of Business – Arizona State University</span></i><span>, Bachelor of Arts (BA), Journalism and Public Relations at </span><i><span>Arizona State University</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Walter Cronkite School of Journalism</span></i><span>, and Culinary Arts – Food and Beverage Management, Cooking, and Related Culinary Arts at </span><i><span>Buontalenti Institute of Culinary Arts and Management</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Gabriele Bertaccini Age</b></h3><p><span>Gabriele Bertaccini was 37 years of age in 2023.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Gabriele Bertaccini Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Gabriele Bertaccini inherits his talents from his parents. His father, Giovanni Bertaccini is a tour operator as well, and his mother sparked Gabriele’s passion for cooking.</span></p><p><span>“I used to cook with my mum, absolutely. My mum, like many other Italian mums, cooked a lot! I used to join her in the kitchen all the time, although I had a much more clinical approach to cooking. The cooking my mum used to do is stamped in my head and I can’t replicate it. I thought a lot about why I wasn’t able to replicate it and realized that was because of the memories that are associated with the food,” he explained</span></p><p><b>Trivia: </b><span>Gabriele has a sister based in Arizona.</span></p><h3><b>Gabriele Bertaccini Height</b></h3><p><span>Gabriele Bertaccini stands tall at a height of under 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Gabriele has a ripped body with tattoos covering his arms and legs.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Gabriele Bertaccini Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Gabriele celebrates his birthday on December 18 and is of the Sagittarius zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Gabriele Bertaccini On Instagram And Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>In April 2023, he entertained 124K followers on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>chefgabebertaccini</span></a><span> and 1.7K followers on Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>GabeBertaccini</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Here are his Facebook accounts @</span><a href=#><span>GabeBertaccini</span></a><span> and @</span><a href=#><span>gabrielebertaccini</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Does Gabriele Bertaccini Reside?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Gabriele resided in Los Angeles in 2023.
