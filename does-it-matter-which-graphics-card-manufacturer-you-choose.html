Do the differences between them matter?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-are-there-different-manufacturers-anyway>Why Are There Different Manufacturers, Anyway?</h2><p>It's an odd situation---almost like if you went shopping for an F-150 pickup truck, and the salesperson asked if you wanted the Ford, Chevy, or Dodge version. For example, a quick search for an "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070" card on Newegg reveals models made by Gigabyte, MSI, and NVIDIA---all on the first page! AMD Radeon graphics cards have a similar variety of suppliers. But within the same specific card design, almost all of them have the same capabilities. What gives?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/d48588b2.jpg><p>The reason is the somewhat unique business-to-business relationships in the GPU market. NVIDIA and AMD sell their chips directly to electronics manufacturers for inclusion in all sorts of stuff, from laptop and desktop computers to game consoles, mobile phones, and even cars. They also sell to third-party graphics card manufacturers like EVGA or Sapphire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These third-party companies take the GPU chips and boards, package them with the necessary extra parts like video ports, coolers, and plastic cases, and then sell them to consumers at retailers like Amazon and Newegg.</p><p>There doesn't necessarily need to be a middleman seller. NVIDIA manufactures Founder's Edition cards itself and sells direct. But the GPU designer/manufacturer/retailer relationship has been going strong since the 1990s, and it looks like it will be the status quo for the foreseeable future.</p><h2 id=what-s-the-difference-between-manufacturers-cards>What's the Difference Between Manufacturers' Cards?</h2><p>All the different card manufacturers get the GPUs from the same place: NVIDIA and AMD. But when selling to consumers, you need to differentiate your product based on price or features. There isn't a lot of wiggle room in the retail prices. Suppose one company goes significantly lower than the others. In that case, everyone tends to follow suit, and with costs like manufacturing and distribution essentially set, there's only so much they can do to remain profitable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So consumer-focused brands will differentiate in other areas. Some might offer blower coolers or open-air coolers. Some will make their cards shorter to fit in more compact cases. Some will try to make their cards stand out with flashy-looking fans and lights. A common technique is making minor changes to the card's design, like a small "factory" (pre-installed) overclock on the card's GPU or V-RAM. These variations get a lot of ink on the boxes that the GPUs come in, with marketing phrases like "Overclocked Edition," "FTW," or "AMP."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/77eb3d84.jpg> NVIDIA <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But except for a few significant tweaks, like a pre-installed water cooling setup or the installation of extra memory modules, these changes usually don't result in more than a percent or two of performance versus the baseline. If two cards from the same NVIDIA or AMD product line are of the same model, and they can fit inside your computer's case and plug into your motherboard, there's not going to be a massive difference in how they make your games look. Company-supplied overclocking, in particular, isn't anything you need to worry about: you'll get more dramatic results by <a href=#>doing it yourself</a>.</p><h2 id=which-changes-really-matter>Which Changes Really Matter?</h2><p>So, which of these changes actually do matter? Well, the card's length is important, especially if you're looking for something high-end. If your case is too small to hold the card, it doesn't matter how fast it is. Designs with more elaborate double- or triple-fan coolers will be longer, while those made specifically for compact Mini-ITX builds will be shorter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>GPU clearance lengths are generally included in the specifications page for your PC's case---if you can't find it, you can always open up the case yourself and measure the space from the back to the front near the PCI-E slot on the motherboard. The specifications page of the card itself will also list its length, but be sure to take into account where the power input is. If your card fits, on paper, within a fraction of an inch but the power cables sticking out the back adds more than that fraction of an inch, then, in reality, your card won't fit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/837468b3.jpg> Zotac <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The difference between a blower and an open-air cooler design is minor, but it's crucial if you have a case with low airflow. <a href=#>Check out this guide</a> to see the different design approaches between the two cooling types. Of course, if you prefer a quieter machine, you can get a more expensive card with a pre-installed water cooler. If you're going to install your own water cooling system with aftermarket hardware, you'll need a pricey custom cooling block, which replaces the stock air cooler and comes from boutique suppliers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/65c1d66a.jpg> EVGA<p>Another change that can significantly alter performance is extra RAM. Some cards can accommodate additional GDDR RAM modules, and secondary manufacturers will install them directly onto the PCB. With more video RAM, a card can hold much more information in local memory, like high-resolution textures and game engine files. That can result in a considerable boost to performance and load times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Extra RAM isn't possible on every card. Still, if a manufacturer includes it, they'll usually highlight it in the card's advertising and packaging and ask for a small premium over the going rate for that model. Since video memory is something you can't upgrade yourself, it's a significant point of differentiation.</p><h2 id=the-real-difference-price-trust-and-warranty>The Real Difference: Price, Trust, And Warranty</h2><p>If there's only a small overclock or a slightly altered cooler separating the two cards you're looking at, then the most significant differentiation is the price. Obviously, the cheaper, the better---especially if you're dropping $300 or more to play the latest games.</p><p>But it might be worth paying a little more for a new graphics card to get a little extra peace of mind. A card from a more reliable manufacturer is desirable. And because "reliable" is a nebulous concept when dealing with complex electronics that are so interconnected, a good warranty and a reputation for honoring it are even better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20adb4d9.jpg> EVGA<p>Most manufacturers offer a two-year or three-year warranty with their cards, and some offer an extension if you register your card with a customer account. (You'll want to keep your proof of purchase either way.) Some, like EVGA, XFX, and Zotac, even have "lifetime" warranties with registration. And sometimes, the warranty can be transferred to a new owner if you sell the card, or the warranty will be honored even if you overclock it yourself.</p><p>You can usually find the warranty terms for the card directly on the sale page. If that doesn't work, Google the manufacturer's name and "warranty" to quickly find the company's official information.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, when shopping for a new graphics card and choosing between two very similar models, go through the following checklist to see the significant points of differentiation. It should help you make a more confident decision.</p><li>Will both cards fit in my PC case?</li><li>Is one card significantly cheaper than the other?</li><li>Does one card have more RAM than the other?</li><li>Do these cards have different cooler designs, and do that matter for my case?</li><li>Does one manufacturer offer significantly better warranty terms?</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhub3BjZLGwsdJmoK1lnZbBtbHRZq6hoZOdeqi%2BwKmfopujYrCivsNmpJqmpZuupMDUq5yrZamkwm6vx6imrJ1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ines-de-ramon-parents-height-net-worth-brad-pitt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Get To Know Ines de Ramon Parents, Height, Net Worth">&larr;
