in an attempt to put a glossy veneer over her criminal past.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>McCollum now has a celebrity manager who appears to have&nbsp;been tasked with turning her into a household name, and just this weekend she was out with a host of reality stars in <a style=font-weight:700 href=#>Birmingham </a>after <a style=font-weight:700 href=#>Geordie Shore</a> star Aaron Chalmers' MMA debut.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These days McCollum never appears to be too far from a camera lens documenting her every move and is often seen with a four-figure designer handbag on her arm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also has been rumoured to have been offered&nbsp;&nbsp;£250,000 for rights to a book, but perhaps the high life is not as lucrative as it seems, as McCollum was spotted signing on at a job centre in Belfast hours after a jaunt in Spain.</p><img id=i-2e1ae9dcc02f56fd
