'And she will be judged just like anybody else -- on the results on the field.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>US Soccer is closing in on naming <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-c7a01fa0-7db0-11ee-9eb2-3be596f4205d>Chelsea</a>'s Hayes as the new coach of the women's national team, a source familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Saturday. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details had not been made public.</p><br><p class=mol-para-with-font>To Lalas, Hayes' arrival means the US women can refocus on winning games, which he believes became secondary in recent years as players gained notoriety for social activism. He didn't mention controversial retired ex-captain <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-c7a3c920-7db0-11ee-9eb2-3be596f4205d>Megan Rapinoe</a> by name, but Lalas seemed to blame activist players with large social media followings for the team's round-of-16 finish at August's World Cup.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I hope that Emma Hayes is given the keys and given the ability to do what she what she feels is appropriate,' Lalas said. 'Now she has a reputation for not suffering fools, and I think that this team and this particular moment, I think it needs to get back to the focus and the priority being on winning soccer games and winning World Cups.</p><img id=i-9a3997c90ebc144e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/07/21/77523925-12722281-image-a-33_1699390827353.jpg height=434 width=634 alt="Chelsea manager Emma Hayes who will leave the club at the end of the season" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Chelsea manager Emma Hayes who will leave the club at the end of the season</p><img id=i-65df37af376ec5a5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/07/21/77524043-12722281-image-a-34_1699390850460.jpg height=573 width=634 alt="Former USMNT defender Alexi Lalas wants Emma Hayes to clean house with the US women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Former USMNT defender Alexi Lalas wants Emma Hayes to clean house with the US women&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I hope Emma Hayes also comes in and cleans house to the extent that she can, and brings in people that she is comfortable with, and focuses back in on, ''I don't care how big a name you are, I don't care how much money you have, I don't care how many followers you have, I don't care what your off-field positions and platforms are – I care that when that whistle blows, that you win soccer games for the United States,' Lalas continued. 'I hope that she is given the opportunity to do that and there's not too many cooks in the kitchen.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fortunately, Lalas explained, Hayes has the personality to do just that.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While he admits he doesn't know her well, Lalas said he and Hayes did meet for drinks at the World Cup, where he was impressed with her outlook.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I got to meet her this summer at the women's World Cup,' he said. 'We had some drinks and I had a really fun time and fun night, conversation with her and the way that she thinks about the game.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But this is still going to be a transition for her into the international game -- not the day-in-day-out routine that she is used to,' he added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier Saturday, Chelsea announced that Hayes will leave the defending Women's Super League champion at the end of the season. Chelsea said she was leaving to 'pursue a new opportunity outside of the WSL and club football.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It's unlikely she will coach at the 2024 Paris Olympics, but Lalas said he hopes she's calling the shots from a distance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I don't know how much impact she is going to have relative to next summer and the Olympics,' Lalas said. 'But I would hope that she is, from afar, dictating what happens. I've said before, I think next summer should be used as an opportunity to blood [debut] as many new players as possible.'</p><img id=i-57a086122aaad006 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/07/21/77523933-12722281-image-a-35_1699390885214.jpg height=476 width=634 alt="Chelsea's Sjoeke Nusken celebrates with manager Emma Hayes after a recent match" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Chelsea's Sjoeke Nusken celebrates with manager Emma Hayes after a recent match&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hayes has won 14 major trophies at Chelsea, including six WSL titles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Former US coach Vlatko Andonovski resigned following the Women's World Cup this past summer in Australia and New Zealand. The United States, which had won two straight World Cups, fell on penalties after a scoreless draw with Sweden in the Round of 16, the earliest-ever exit for the Americans in the tournament.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The United States had never finished worse than third at previous World Cups.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Andonovski, who was named coach of the United States in October 2019, finished 51-5-9 during his time with the team, and was 3-2-5 in major tournaments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last month, Andonovski was named coach of the Kansas City Current in the National Women's Soccer League. Twila Kilgore, an assistant on Andonovski's US team staff, was named interim head coach of the team.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There was an urgency to hire a new US coach ahead of the Paris Olympics next summer. The team has two additional exhibition matches scheduled this year, both against China, on Dec. 2 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and on Dec. 5 at Toyota Stadium outside of Dallas.</p><img id=i-209b340cd76b6002 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/07/21/77524143-12722281-image-a-36_1699390915200.jpg height=422 width=634 alt="Lalas did not mention Megan Rapinoe by name, but seemed to reference her activism" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Lalas did not mention Megan Rapinoe by name, but seemed to reference her activism</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Other candidates considered for the job included former US assistant Tony Gustavsson, who is currently coach of Australia's women's team, and Laura Harvey, coach of OL Reign in the NWSL.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hayes has led Chelsea to two domestic league and cup doubles and one trophy treble since taking over the team in 2012.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Emma has been one of the biggest drivers of change in women's football.
