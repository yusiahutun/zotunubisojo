Make sure that the good smelling shampoo you aim to pick checks a few significant factors to ensure you are making the best pick.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best Smelling Shampoo?</h2></p><p>While most shampoos are picked based on hair concern or hair type, when it comes to choosing the best smelling shampoo, there are a few key factors that you must consider to make sure you invest in the right product. Listed below are some things that you must consider -</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>Reading the fine print on the label to understand what goes in the formula is an important step. Many shampoos have chemicals and preservatives that can leave a harmful impact on your hair. You must pick something formulated with good ingredients to allow your tresses to soak up all the hair-loving ingredients. Pick a shampoo with ingredients that help in enhancing its texture and cater to the concerns. Those with curly, coiled, kinky, dry, thick, or coarse hair must pick hydrating and moisturizing shampoos with shea butter, argan oil, or jojoba oil. Anyone with oily, fine, or thin hair should use lightweight aloe vera, honey, or biotin shampoos.&nbsp;Our contributor Nate Masterson, a Hair Expert for Maple Holistics, shares details about the best ingredients for great smelling shampoo. She says, “Lavender is a fantastic scent to have in a shampoo. Not only does it smell great, but there are various studies linking the scent of lavender to enhanced calmness and it also induces feelings of calmness within the brain. Herbaceous ingredients such as eucalyptus, rosemary, and sage also have fantastic nourishing and hydrating properties and they smell great too. Finally, citrus scents like lemon and orange not only smell great in your hair but they promote freshness which can also enhance your mental clarity.”</p><p>For nice smelling shampoos, ensure the formula contains essential oils or botanical extracts for fragrance. Avoid synthetic fragrances or adulterated essential oils. These can lead to a lot of sensitivities or allergies on your scalp. If you cannot go through every little ingredient mentioned, look for products that are labeled as vegan, clean, organic, or all-natural. While these may still contain a few unwanted ingredients, they are safe for your hair as they contain natural plants and botanical-based ingredients.</p><p><strong>Chemicals</strong></p><p>When picking any hair care product, the onus is on us to ensure that it is not loaded with harmful chemicals. Some common toxins to avoid include sulfates, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, lanolin, synthetic dyes, mineral oil, and, most importantly - artificial fragrances. Artificial scents can often lead to hair dryness, breakage or hair fall, and even scalp irritation. And this is why it is best to pick a good-smelling shampoo with natural essential oils or botanical extracts.</p><p><strong>Consider Your Scent Preferences</strong></p><p>Choosing the best smelling shampoo is very much like picking a new perfume or cologne. You must first determine the type of fragrance that you will surely enjoy. Be it fruity, floral, citrusy scents, or something else. The best way to distinguish is to think about the fragrances in other products like lotions or perfumes. When you know the fragrance, you will understand the scent that you naturally gravitate towards.</p><p>Take this as your cue, and then start your hunt. The easy way to go around it is to see the packaging of the shampoo. Brands usually highlight the main fragrance notes or describe the overall aroma of the shampoo, which can help you instantly determine whether it aligns with your preferences.</p><p><strong>Determine Complementary Scents and Products</strong></p><p>While picking a really good smelling shampoo, you must also consider the other hair or personal care products you will use. In the case of conditioners, ensure that a shampoo with a fragrance complements the conditioner’s fragrance too. Make sure that both the fragrances do not clash else it will create an imbalance of scents and will become too overpowering. You can also opt for a shampoo and conditioner pair from the same brand, as they are typically tailored to work in perfect harmony together.</p><p><strong>Experiment With Samples</strong></p><p>In case you are unsure of the fragrance notes, try out a sample size or a travel-size version of the shampoo to test it out. This allows you to understand if the shampoo suits your hair. It also gives you an insight if the fragrance suits your personality and whether it lingers throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Other Factors</strong></p><p>For those hoping to use a shampoo that will become your go-to pick, you must double-check if its fragrance is fit enough to be your signature scent. Also, remember that while scent might be an essential factor, it is not the only factor of the shampoo to consider. Ensure you check its suitability for your hair type, nourishing properties, lathering ability, and whether it is prone to causing allergy or irritation to your scalp. Pick a shampoo that smells amazing and gives you happy, healthy, and well-nourished hair.</p><p>Our contributor Nate Masterson, who is a hair expert for Maple Holistics, explains, “The frequency of hair washes you need is directly related to what kind of hair type you have and also if you have any other hair issues such as dandruff or scalp psoriasis. For example, if your hair is very oily then I’d suggest washing it daily or every second day if you use a clarifying</p><p>shampoo. Additionally, if your hair has been chemically treated you’ll want to wash it less frequently because washing chemically-treated hair can cause the treatment to fade sooner. Finally, if you have coily (textured) hair you may need to wash it only once a week, and if your coils are very tight you may only need to wash it every other week.”</p><p>No one wishes to use a shampoo that leaves your hair smelling lackluster or undernourished.
