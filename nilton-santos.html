This was substantial consolation for the fact that he had been sent off in the quarter-finals of the 1954 competition and that, although called up for the 1950 World Cup, when Brazil played host, he did not get a game in that tournament. There would be plenty more to come: Santos won more than 80 caps for his country. Tall, powerfully built, elegant and versatile, he was usually cool under pressure, turned quickly for such a big man, tackled firmly and was always ready to surge forward and make use of his strong left foot.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Santos was born on Governador Island in Rio, the first of seven children. His first club, at the age of 14, was Flexeiras, a local amateur team. Santos joined Botafogo of Rio, made his debut for the side in March 1948, and gained his first cap for Brazil the following year in the South American Championship. He later formed a powerful partnership at full-back with <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Djalma Santos</a> (no relation) in the international side. He stayed with Botafogo for his whole career, made more than 700 appearances and was a member of the Botafogo teams that won the state championship of Rio in 1948 and 1957.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>There were two games that he must have wished to forget. The first was the 1954 World Cup quarter-final in Switzerland that was dubbed the "battle of Berne". This torrid six-goal contest between Brazil and Hungary, the tournament's favourites, quickly degenerated into violence and, in the second half, Santos came to blows with the Hungarian right-half, József Bozsik. The Yorkshire referee, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Arthur Ellis</a>, promptly sent them both off. There was further violence to come and Brazil crashed out of the tournament, losing 4-2. Then on <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">9 May 1956 at Wembley</a>, the 30-year-old Santos found himself confronted by <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Stanley Matthews</a>, recalled to the England team at the age of 41. Santos, who later professed immense admiration for Matthews, could make nothing of him that afternoon. England won 4-2, but even that score flattered Brazil. Matthews was one of the few wingers ever to embarrass Santos.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>At the 1958 <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>World Cup</a> in Sweden, Brazil introduced the four-in-line defence to the game, which Santos found ideal. Majestically, he strolled through the opening rounds – and scored a superb goal against Austria – but when it came to the final, in Solna, there were serious doubts over whether he could contain the rapid and elusive Swedish winger Kurt Hamrin, who had turned the German defence inside out in the semi-final in Gothenburg. In the event, it was no contest as both Nilton and Djalma Santos seized control. Nilton completely subdued Hamrin as, on the opposite flank, Djalma did the same against the speedy Lennart "Nacka" Skoglund. Though they gave away an early goal, Brazil eventually won the final 5-2.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>In Chile, four years later, Djalma and Nilton were again full-back partners. At the age of 37, Nilton was as dominant and composed as ever, in a Brazilian team now playing a 4-3-3 rather than a 4-2-4 formation. With Pelé injured in Brazil's second game, the dynamic but eccentric right-winger Garrincha emerged as the star of the show. <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Brazil</a> roared their way through the competition to a 3-1 victory against Czechoslovakia in the final.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Garrincha owed much to Nilton Santos, his Botafogo team-mate. In 1958, Santos had led a deputation of players to the Brazilian manager, Vicente Feola, to ask for Garrincha to be included. Garrincha duly made his debut against the Soviet Union in Gothenburg that year. As the teams lined up before the kick-off, Santos murmured to Garrincha that he hoped he wouldn't let them down. By way of reply, Garrincha cheerfully responded, "Look at that linesman – he looks like Charlie Chaplin!" Both players excelled in the ensuing 2-0 victory.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Off the field, Santos was a genial and popular figure, with an encyclopedic knowledge of the game and a love of fishing. He wrote an autobiography in 1998 and the same year was included by journalists in a world football team of the 20th century. In 2004, he was picked by Pelé as one of the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">125 greatest players</a>, to mark Fifa's 100th anniversary.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Santos had two children, Carlos Eduardo and Andréa, with his first wife.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Nilton dos Santos, footballer, born 16 May 1925; died 27 November 2013</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ6fpMGjrculZmtoYWh8r7vVaGlxZ56eubW7zWaqmqakpMA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./holy-cow-how-hong-kong-got-its-beef-eating-meat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Opinion | Holy cow!
