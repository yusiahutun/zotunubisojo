Now, <a href=#>Matthew Perry</a>‘s stepdad Keith Morrison, has said his death is with him “all the time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1394236827-735x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keith-morrison-says-matthew-perry-s-mom-isn-t-having-an-easy-time>Keith Morrison says Matthew Perry’s mom isn’t having an ‘easy time’</h2><p>Canadian broadcaster and journalist, Keith Morrison, who married Perry’s mom, Suzanne Perry, in 1981 has opened up about his grief following the star’s death.</p><p>“It’s as other people have told me hundreds of times; it doesn’t go away yet,”&nbsp;the 76-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Hoda Kotb&nbsp;on her Making Space podcast. “It’s with you every day. It’s with you all the time, and there’s some new aspect of it that assaults your brain, and it’s not easy,” he continued.</p><p>After Perry’s tragic death, Morrison and his wife, Suzanne, were pictured arriving at the scene later that night. Speaking on his wife, Keith admitted it “especially isn’t easy” for her.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m giving away too much by saying that towards the end of his life, they were closer than I’ve seen them in decades,” the Dateline corrospondent revealed. “Texting each other constantly and him sharing things with her that most middle aged men don’t share with their mothers.”</p><p>The 76-year-old then went on to reveal his stepson was ‘happy’ and that “he said so, and he hadn’t said that for a long time.</p><p>&nbsp;It’s a source of comfort, but also, he didn’t get to have his third act, and that’s not fair,” he emotionally revealed.</p><p>He then referred back what the <a href=#>TV</a> star had said before he died, “‘If if I suddenly died,&nbsp;people would be shocked, but not too many people would be surprised.’ And he was right.”</p><p>Asked on whether he surprised, Morrison said: “It was the news you never want to get, but you think someday you might. So yes, and no, I guess is the answer to that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-s-mom-and-stepdad-set-up-matthew-perry-foundation>The star’s mom and stepdad set up Matthew Perry foundation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-72171256-1024x757.jpg><p>The 54-year-old had battled substance abuse for years, which he had been open about before his death. While he experienced his career high, during the peak of the sitcom, Matthew had some of his lowest points with<a href=#> his alcohol addiction</a>, prompting his castmates, including <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> to speak up.</p><p>The goal of the foundation is to “do whatever needs to be done to help organziations that are trying to identify the disease and how to deal with it.”</p><p>Perry had previously <a href=#>established Perry House</a>, which was a man’s sober living society, from 2013-2015.</p><p>Speaking to Tom Power, on the Q podcast less than a year before his tragic death,&nbsp;the <a href=#>movie</a> star shared that he wanted to be remembered for how he helped others.</p><p>“When I die, I don’t want Friends to be the first thing that’s mentioned. I want that to be the first thing that’s mentioned. And I’m gonna live the rest of my life proving that.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aAcLnArauhnadivaa%2B0bJksJmjYrCwutKtmKesnK56tbHXraCnn12dtrR5zKikZqyfrK6zsNJmq6GdXZq7pXnOn2ShoaNiuaqyxGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./missouri-garden-shops.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Missouri Gardening Shops and Nurseries">&larr;
