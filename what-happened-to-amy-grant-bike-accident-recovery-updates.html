The contemporary Christian artist revealed details about her injuries and condition in the months that followed. </span><b>Scroll below for details on what happened to Amy.&nbsp;</b></p><h2><b>What Happened to Amy Grant?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Amy was biking near ​​the Harpeth Hills Golf Course in Nashville with a friend when she hit a pothole and fell off her bike. The <a href=#>Grammy</a> winner was knocked out for nearly 10 minutes before an ambulance came and rushed her to Vanderbilt Medical Center. Amid Amy’s hospitalization for a concussion and multiple cuts and abrasions, her husband, </span><b>Vince Gill</b><span>, updated fans on his wife’s condition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“My bride, Amy, is doing fine,” he told the crowd during an August 2022 concert, adding, “Thank God she was wearing her helmet.”</span></p><p>Amy broke her silence in an Instagram post on August 27, 2022, exactly one month after the crash.</p><p>“I want to say thank you to everyone who has written me a note, sent flowers or gifts, or said a prayer on my behalf,” she wrote. “I’m one month into a recovery that has held so many unexpected hidden gifts. On the advice of my doctors and other friends who have been through similar experiences of recovery, I am choosing to give myself the gift of a very simple fall season. I look forward to making music with Michael W. and Vince during the Christmas season. With deep appreciation and joy…. xo Amy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Happened-to-Amy-Grant-Bike-Accident-Recovery-Updates-.jpg><p><span>A few months after her accident, Amy returned to the stage to perform on her Christmas tour with </span><b>Michael W. Smith</b><span>. She admitted that she was still facing the effects of her injuries while getting back to her music career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Well, they said a 12 to 18-month recovery for a head injury and so every once in a while, I’ll be talking to somebody and they’ll say something that I guess I used to know, and I’ll gasp and go, ‘Are you kidding me?’” she reflected during a January 2023 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>She shared a specific anecdote relating to memory loss with E! News. “I was at dinner the other night with a high school friend,” she shared. “We used to spend the night at each other’s houses. I said, ‘I’m embarrassed to ask you, are you and your husband still together?’ She said that Douglas died seven years ago and it was like I had just heard it for the first time.”</p><p>Amy also faced difficulty with remembering song lyrics and revealed she had to use a teleprompter while performing at the Live at the Music Center: Concert Celebrating Jerry Mossa in January 2023, as well as during her Christmas tour at the end of 2022.</p><p>Still, she kept a positive outlook. “Six months in, so I feel really good!” she shared. “I anticipate just getting better.”</p><p>The musician credited her husband with helping her get through the recovery. “The biggest thing was in the two months after the wreck, it was really depressing,” she admitted. “Everything [was] canceled and I just said, “What if I’m never all the way back?’ And he said, ‘Things happen to people every day and you just have to take it one day at a time, and we’re here, and I love you.’ And that just kind of made every day of the journey okay. And I do feel fantastic.”</p><h2><b>Why Did Amy Grant Have Surgery?</b></h2><p><span>The Kennedy Center Honoree also experienced some hurdles when it came to her voice.</span></p><p><span>“[I was] working with a vocalist and she said, ‘What is happening in your throat? Lean your head back,’” Amy recalled during a March 2023 interview on </span><i><span>Today</span></i><span>. “And I said, ‘I know. It’s like I’ve got an Adam’s apple that keeps getting bigger.’ Unbeknownst to me, I’d had a thyroglossal duct cyst.”</span></p><p><span>The Georgia native underwent surgery to have the cyst removed earlier this year. The news came nearly two years after Amy underwent open heart surgery to fix a birth defect that led one side of her heart to enlarge. After all of her health issues, the songstress has maintained a positive outlook on life as she looks toward the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I feel fantastic,” she said. “I mean, really from 2020 on, I feel like … if I were a car, I’ve made a lot of trips to the shop. And I feel like I’m emerging. I went, ‘Oh man, I feel like a classic now.’ And actually, sort of re-revved up in a really beautiful way.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeqK52Gaeq5meqXqjtcqeZJqbk56xprrTZqmem5%2BrsrPFjK6nnZmkmsBw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./angeli-pangilinan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Angeli Pangilinan dating?
