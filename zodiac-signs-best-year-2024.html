If you’re one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>zodiac signs who will have the best year 2024</a>, you’ll be delighted to see what the stars have in store for you next year. In 2023, the highs were high and the lows were low, but the astrology of 2024 is a chance to start fresh. This year is driving you toward revolutionary pursuits, so don’t be surprised if your life—and the rest of the world—looks very different by the time we reach 2025.</p><p>2024 begins with lucky planet Jupiter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>no longer retrograde</a>, instilling the collective with hope, faith, and optimism for a brighter future ahead. Mercury retrograde <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>will also have come to an end</a> in Sagittarius on January 1, bringing ideas, thoughts, and long-term goals back to speed. This cosmic pick-me-up is followed by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Pluto’s big return to change-agent Aquarius</a> on January 20, as well as Uranus stationing direct on January 27. Rethinking your values could usher in unexpected opportunities and fresh perspectives, especially when it comes to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the astrological houses</a> ruled by Taurus and Aquarius in your birth chart. Don’t be afraid to test your luck and venture outside of what is familiar to you. You could discover an untapped talent or an unconventional source of income.&nbsp;</p><p>The more grounded you are, the easier it will be to navigate the first eclipse season of 2024. Taking place just days <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>after the spring equinox</a>—not to mention an unpredictable Mars-Uranus square—there will be a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>lunar eclipse in Libra</a> on March 25, followed by a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>solar eclipse in Aries</a> on April 8. This chaotic period will encourage you to let go of the connections and commitments that aren’t reciprocating your investments, allowing you to unapologetically take control of your life and lead with confidence and independence. On April 20, a riveting Jupiter-Uranus conjunction in Taurus could bring shocking developments that are surprisingly beneficial to you. The best part? Venus will join forces <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with Jupiter in Taurus</a> on May 23, adding to the abundance. Mark this date on your calendars, as this will be one of the most auspicious moments of 2024.</p><p>By May 25, lucky Jupiter will make its debut in Gemini for the first time since 2013, where it will remain until 2025. This 13-month-long transit will quench our collective curiosities and promote growth in global communications. Harness this mentally stimulating energy by diving into intellectual pursuits. Before 2024 comes to a close, there will be a partial lunar eclipse on September 17, taking place in Pisces for the first time in almost 10 years. Where is Pisces located in your chart? And what were you up to back in March 2015? It could explain what this next journey will have in store for you. This is the first of an eclipse series that will continue throughout 2025-2026, so consider this a prelude for what’s to come.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-4-zodiac-signs-will-have-the-best-year-2024>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Have the Best Year 2024</h2><p>If your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a>, or most importantly, your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following zodiac signs, the year 2024 could be one to remember.
