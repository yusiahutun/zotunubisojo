Although your exact age can say so much about your maturity levels, the truth is—age is so much more than a number. In fact, there might be an even more cosmic reason for how old you act, because <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>every zodiac sign represents an age period</a> in life.</p><p>Your birth chart is always a map of your life, and each year, the calendar begins <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with Aries—the infant</a>—and ends with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Pisces—the elderly</a>. From start to finish, the cycle of the 12 zodiac signs is a journey of rebirth that resets itself each year. And by understanding the age bracket that each zodiac sign is associated with, you’ll be able to better understand not only their personalities, but what each era of your life will entail.</p><p>Because the practice of astrology delves even deeper than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your birth chart</a> and your overall personality, the ages of each zodiac sign can be used to solve mysteries, find missing objects, and gain clarity on all sorts of subjects. If you were to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>calculate a chart for an event</a> rather than a person, you could look to the zodiac signs involved to understand how long something has been taking place or the age of a participant involved in the event. After all, the process of analyzing astrology is all about deciphering clues and making logical associations based on planetary configurations and the zodiac signs involved.</p><p>If you were wondering how old you really seem to everyone else, here’s the age bracket each zodiac sign represents:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5><h2>Aries: 1 to 7</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1412306480.jpg><p>Because Aries is the first sign in the zodiac, it represents everything we feel, see, and experience for the first time. It also means that Aries rules over the first seven years of our life, which explains this cardinal fire sign’s courageous and action-packed personality. Aries is often passionate, impulsive, and quick-to-anger, which reflects the intense pull of a young child’s desire to take on the world. Babies, toddlers, and little kids are free from the self-consciousness that often holds so many adults back, as they have not yet adapted to the boundaries and expectations of society. They are free from self-judgment, which speaks to the Aries way of doing first and asking questions later. After all, small children are quite literally high on life and ready to create chaos at a moment’s notice.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Taurus: 7 to 14</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-475148515.jpg><p>Taurus represents late childhood all the way into the preteen years, as this is when you start forming your core values and deciding what you truly stand for. Taurus is a stability-seeking earth sign ruled by Venus—planet of love and material possessions—and it is during this era of your life that you begin to form longterm relationships and goals. It is also when you may start feeling more hesitant to share your personal items with everyone, as this is the period of life in which you acquire small amounts money and resources that belong entirely to you. What preteen doesn’t feel irrationally protective of their Pokémon card collection? It also explains the stubborn, yet youthful Taurus disposition, as preteens are often very concerned with making up their own minds and defining their own tastes, interests, and principles.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Gemini: 14 to 21</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1241442959.jpg><p>Is anyone surprised Geminis are the teenagers of the zodiac? It’s between ages 14 to 21 that you truly begin establishing a social circle and communication style. It’s during your Gemini years that you navigate high school cliques and college Greek culture, bouncing between the desire to voice your authentic truth and to conform to what’s considered “cool” and acceptable. Gemini is also the zodiac sign that describes the nature of people, and it’s during your teenage and young adult years that you learn a lot about what people are really like. It’s when you develop labels for yourself that give you a sense of identity and belonging, rebelling against the moralistic ideas of what constitutes “good” or “bad” that our elders ingrained in us. It’s when you begin to learn the truth about the world and how to navigate it.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Cancer: 21 to 28</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1323690734.jpg><p>It’s during your twenties that you begin to develop your own understanding of home, separate from the one that raised you. Your Cancer years last from 21 to 28, just before your Saturn return begins. This is when many people move out of their parent or guardian’s house for the first time, showing you how to establish your own space in the world. However, everyone’s idea of home looks different, which is why you’ll find people planting roots in a wide variety of ways during this time. Some will get married and become parents for the first time. Many will adopt their first pet. Most will sign leases on their first apartments and strengthen the bonds of their chosen family. A few will buy their first home. This is when you really begin to plant the seeds of your adult life and build the home you’ve always wanted.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8945147679325><h2>Leo: 28 to 35</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1474506465.jpg><p>Leo is the zodiac sign of drama, theatrics, creativity, and confident self-expression. It only makes sense that your Leo years kick off with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the dreaded Saturn return</a>. It’s between ages 28 and 35 that you really start reaping the rewards of all the hard work you’ve been putting into the structure of your life; a process that began as early as childhood. This era begins with the Saturn return, a cosmic reality check that forces you to leave behind detrimental patterns and embrace the wisdom of maturity. And once you’ve entered your early thirties, you know you’re ready to party (and be in bed by 11 p.m. sharp). This is when you feel like your biggest and baddest self, as you’ve conquered so many of the insecurities that filled your mind during your twenties. By now, you’ve probably made headway in your career, earned yourself some money, and learned how to flirt. Get out there and enjoy it!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Virgo: 35 to 42</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1186933471.jpg><p>By the time you’ve reached your Virgo years, you’re a much more responsible, focused, and hard-working adult. You’ve had plenty of wild and exciting experiences, and now, you’re starting to think a bit more about the later years of your life and how you can set yourself up for lifelong happiness. It’s between ages 35 to 42 that your health becomes a bigger concern, encouraging you to establish a healthier diet and fitness regimen. It’s also when you become more of a planner, as you’ve leveled up in your career and taken on new responsibilities. You may be managing your children’s busy schedules and nurturing their growth. You might be getting serious about planning for retirement. You may even be offering guidance and providing help to your younger contemporaries as an older and more experienced mentor. Virgo is nothing if not actionable and serviceable.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Libra: 42 to 49</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1371643087.jpg><p>By your Libra years, you’ve had countless relationships—good, bad, passionate, boring, frustrating, sweet, and everything in-between. Between ages 42 to 49, you’ve learned that who you choose to team up with has a direct impact on your happiness and stability. And it’s during this time that many will make profound decisions to commit to someone else. This may be when you choose to marry your soulmate; the partner that truly brings out the best in you. This could be when you decide to enter a business partnership with another capable human. And because Libra is the zodiac sign of harmony and justice, you tend to embrace a more selfless and compromising attitude when it comes to your relationships and career endeavors. You may also establish more work-life balance than in your previous years.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Scorpio: 49 to 56</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1316488076.jpg><p>Scorpio is the zodiac sign of transformation, intimacy, financial debts, as well as death and rebirth. Is it any wonder your Scorpio years are also when the midlife crisis often begins? It’s between ages 49 to 56 that we often reevaluate our lives and the direction its taken. Perhaps some of your life decisions and goals did not amount to what you thought it would. Maybe your tastes and interests have changed. And during your Scorpio years, you often break ties with some of the commitments you made when you were younger. You might be ready to get a divorce and fall in love all over again. You may feel ready to quit your job and start a completely new venture. You may even deal with the loss of a parent, which can be just as heartbreaking as it is liberating. Your Scorpio years are a reminder that you’re never too old to change. And like clockwork, it’s during this era that many of us embrace a strengthening and awakening metamorphosis.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Sagittarius: 56 to 63</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1287257749.jpg><p>Once you’ve made it through your midlife crisis, you begin what is arguably the most exciting period of your entire life—your Sagittarius years! It’s during ages 56 to 63 that you finally stop caring what other people think and start living life on your own terms. You’ve experienced many losses in life by now, but you’ve gained just as much wisdom in the process. And by surviving all that you’ve been through, you no longer sweat the small stuff. By now, you’re well aware that you’re more than halfway through your life, which gives you courage and confidence to do what you want, when you want. There’s no more wasting time! You’re ready to plan extended vacations, take up new hobbies, and some may even go back to school to learn new things. During your Sag years, you may feel more youthful and open-minded than ever before.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5><h2>Capricorn: 63 to 70</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1124225712.jpg><p>By the time you’ve reached your Capricorn years, you’ve truly become an authority in your family, your community, and of course, in your career. You’ve spend your whole life building a legacy, both at work and at home. If you had kids, they’re most likely adults by now, making you feel proud of all they’ve accomplished with your care and support. You’ve worked your way up in your career, reaching top positions and establishing yourself as an expert in your field. You may be gearing up to sell your business, your home, or cash in on your stock and investment portfolio. If you spent your younger years delaying gratification and embracing the promise of patience, discipline, and long-term growth, your Capricorn years are bound to make you feel more powerful than ever. After all, you’ve watched the life you’ve built come together beautifully.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Aquarius: 70 to 77</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1362058654.jpg><p>There’s a reason you see so many senior citizens making creative fashion choices and rebelling against the status quo. After all, ages 70 to 77 are known as the Aquarius years. Because Aquarius is the zodiac sign of community, innovation, revolution, and eccentricity. By the time you’ve reached your Aquarius years, you may feel more detached from the world’s expectations than ever before. At this age, you’ve lived long enough to witness plenty of injustices and realize all the ways our society can be improved for future generations. You may join clubs, reignite your social life, and of course, join forces with people who share your concerns. You may even be seen as a leader in your community; as someone who contains a great deal of wisdom and know-how that can be called on for insight.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6><h2>Pisces: 77+</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1312077011.jpg><p>Your Pisces years can be the most spiritual, introspective, and imaginative years of your life. When you reach the age of 77, your Pisces period is initiated, imbuing your heart with depth, understanding, and of course, forgiveness. It’s during this time that you may have more spiritual experiences, as your loved ones in the afterlife begin visiting you more often than usual. Your level of empathy is increased, as you find it in your heart to let things go after holding on to grievances throughout your life. Your artistic abilities are reawakened, as your strengthening connection with outer realms gives you access to colors, ideas, and emotional energies that drive you to spread beauty before you leave this plane for the next. Those born under the Pisces zodiac sign often carry the wisdom of old age with them, as their souls tend to be highly experienced.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbq3SZpignaNk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-smelling-shampoo-1225266.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Best Smelling Shampoos to Make Your Hair Smell Like a Dream">&larr;
