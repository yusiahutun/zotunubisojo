Despite being Daddy Yankee’s youngest child, Jeremy works hard behind the scenes to succeed in the entertainment industry like his father.</p><p>As the youngest son, Jeremy had a happy childhood with his parents and siblings, and he looked up to his father. Furthermore, his father’s success as a rapper must have influenced his career choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-23_6_7_46.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeremy_Ayala_Gonzalez_Is_Married></span>Jeremy Ayala González Is Married<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Daddy Yankee’s son is married to a stunning Instagram influencer and Puerto Rican publicist, Andrea De Castro Font.
