While many of my friends and peers struggled with hormonal breakouts, acne and typical 'teenage skin', I was never on the receiving end of bad breakouts - <strong>until I hit my 20s, that is.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=esuszSPVjs data-wc=84>Ironically, I worked in beauty and cosmetic PR before I became a journalist, and spent much of my time researching the benefits behind even the most obscure skincare ingredients. At the time, I could tell you what every single ingredient in your cleanser does for your skin. I can still list <a class=hm-link href=#>the benefits of retinoids</a> like the alphabet. What I couldn't do, however, was prevent the sudden and unexpected change in my complexion that happened shortly after the pandemic plunged the world into lockdown.</p><p id=eLuA_xmpFf data-wc=46>Almost overnight, my once clear skin was plagued with textured bumps, which soon turned to painful, cystic breakouts. These stuck around for several months, leaving behind a barrage of dark scars whenever I wasn't experiencing active flare ups. I had <a class=hm-link href=#>adult acne</a>, and felt totally helpless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3759cfa18c6e-adult-acne.jpg><p id=eT0GhaSLoe data-wc=70>Even more frustrating, was that I was doing everything we're told to do to promote healthy skin. Lockdown gave me time to nail a disciplined, healthy lifestyle, so there was no shortage of leafy greens or skin-loving ingredients in my diet. I was getting daily fresh air, I was hardly wearing make-up, I stopped drinking alcohol, and yet each day I'd wake up with an unwelcome cluster of newly-formed spots.</p><p id=eKRa3qmFKs data-wc=40>My GP suggested Roaccutane. A dermatologist prescribed me Tretinoin. <strong>TikTok convinced me I'd given myself fungal acne from at-home dermaplaning.</strong> For months I tried to work out what was behind my skin breakouts, but could never find the answer.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">MORE BEAUTY COLLECTIVE</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="This is how ditching micellar water changed my skincare game for 2024" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/eeff42afd43d-face-wash.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="This is how ditching micellar water changed my skincare game for 2024" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>This is how ditching micellar water changed my skincare game for 2024</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I swear by this must-have skincare ingredient to soothe my problem skin – and experts agree" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8754d0d473e8-skincare.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I swear by this must-have skincare ingredient to soothe my problem skin – and experts agree" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I swear by this must-have skincare ingredient to soothe my problem skin – and experts agree</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="A beauty editor's honest review of the latest vitamin C serums" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f16be9f0d92e-new-cms-templates-copy.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="A beauty editor's honest review of the latest vitamin C serums" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>A beauty editor's honest review of the latest vitamin C serums</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=epxzTGMt4LP data-wc=73>Adjusting to my new reflection is one of the most challenging things I've had to do. I felt deeply insecure about leaving the house, horrified at the thought of turning my camera on for Zoom calls and developed a love-hate relationship with my bathroom mirror. Love, because it was the only place I allowed myself to be face-to-face with my skin, and hate, because I was constantly reminded of how different I looked.</p><p id=ejZreKsFli data-wc=34>Nearly four years on, my skin has (thankfully) calmed down, but I'm still partial to an angry breakout.<strong>&nbsp;I never did get to the bottom of why my skin flared up like it did.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a31a7554acf8-clear-skin.jpg><p id=e8psQmjAjU data-wc=23></p><h2>Have a little patience</h2><p id=eAALVYHIdU data-wc=65>There is no quick fix to solving adult acne. Be it induced by hormone changes, lifestyle shifts, diet intolerances or stress, you'll need to be patient and kind to yourself while working out what's going on with your microbiome. After trying what felt like 'everything' to fix my acne, I swear by the belief that patience was the only thing that truly healed my skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_aDQrk7nw data-wc=32>Every skin journey is different, but the chances are that a sudden, major change in your complexion is related to hormonal changes - and these can take a long time to settle.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYxhyBazawn data-wc=14><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Can drinking collagen really help my skin? I tried it for six months</a></strong></p><h2>Strip back your skincare routine&nbsp;</h2><p id=e9RXJlz5o9 data-wc=54>As a self-confessed skincare junkie I used to lather my skin in a cocktail of active ingredients without truly knowing how my skin responded to each one.

"Think of it initially as a drink for your skin. We then add a cocktail of ingredients that can target specific concerns. The hour-long, 6-in-1 process mixes water micro-dermabrasion, AHA exfoliation, vitamin and peptide infusion, pain-free extractions, and LED light therapy."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eDdae67pYZ data-wc=63>The HydraFacial is extremely gentle, and was the only facial I found my skin could handle when my breakouts were at their worst.

It might seem simple, but when my confidence was at its lowest, I longed for the day when I could run my hands across my cheeks and not feel any texture.</p><p id=etGlg7orGh data-wc=84>Sadly, wishing on pen and paper performed no such miracles on my skin, but I did find documenting my journey really helpful when it came to noticing the small changes. I got so used to seeing my skin with spots that I almost didn't notice when it started to clear up. Looking back on photos from the worst days helped me to identify what was going on in my life at that time, and whether or not stress had affected a particularly bad breakout.</p><span class=socialEmbedCaptionClass_s1blps23>I documented my skin journey to track changes in my lifestyle</span><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eR-ZB1bSbJ data-wc=37>It also helps to document what skincare ingredients you're using, whether you've cut anything out of your diet, or how you've been sleeping - so you can replicate that whenever you go through a 'good skin' period.&nbsp;</p><h2>Limit your alcohol intake</h2><p id=ewIl3U1602 data-wc=51>I'm partial to a picante and a spicy margarita at the best of times, but I regret to admit whenever I've had more than a few drinks I can almost guarantee I'll wake up with spots the next day. <strong>To seriously heal my skin, I stopped drinking completely for six months.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=ezjhyuJAwM1 data-wc=29>If you notice inflammation in your skin after a night out, it's worth considering switching to low-alcohol or alcohol free options while you give your skin time to recover.</p><p id=eqhQBi2O2Q data-wc=11><strong>DISCOVER: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How I fell back in love with my skincare routine</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Consider a personalised skincare routine</h2><p id=er68nVLoSz data-wc=42><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Skin+Me</a></span> was a game changer when it came to working out exactly what I needed to put on my face.
