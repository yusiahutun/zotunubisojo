When he finished, his long-sleeved, plaid button-up was soaked in sweat, but he looked as if he could have gone another hour. If you worried that at age 71 he may melt in these conditions, you've forgotten he's from Texas.</p><p>A dense breeze did little to tame the&nbsp;temperature (about 88 degrees to start) as Strait quickly deviated from previous sets to open with "Write This Down." The night's first tribute came next: It was subtle, but as he closed "I Got a Car," he tapped his heart and pointed up to remember songwriter Keith Gattis, who <a href=#>died</a> after a tractor accident in April.&nbsp;Strait's not really one to bring big emotions to the stage, as&nbsp;shown later in the show when <a href=#>Chris Stapleton</a> joined for three songs. The men gave each other a hardy handshake instead of the kind of bro-hug popular&nbsp;between younger contemporaries.</p><p>The night was unique in that it was filled with covers and tributes. Early stops on this small stadium tour have repeated a very similar setlist, but during&nbsp;Strait's first night in Nashville, the legend included songs like "Blue Clear Sky," which Setlist.fm says he hasn't played since 2019. The fan-generated setlist archive is hardly definitive, but this No. 1 from 1996 is rare.</p><p>Just before that, he reached back for "That's My Kind of Woman," a deep cut from Just Comes Natural. Setlist.fm will tell you he's never played that song before. Who knows what's on tap for Night No. 2 on Saturday (July 29)?</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>20 Best George Strait Songs</a></p><p>Calling Strait&nbsp;a stand-and-sing act diminishes the simple power of melodic songs like "Give It Away," "Here for&nbsp;a Good Time," "Amarillo&nbsp;by Morning" and so many more. The music connects, so he doesn't have to work too hard to force it. That was particularly evident during a pair of Bob Wills covers late in the show. Fans weren't as familiar with "Take Me Back&nbsp;to Tulsa" and "Milk Cow Blues,"&nbsp;two songs that&nbsp;acted more as a band feature — or bridge to a trio of closing songs — than highlights.</p><p>Other legends Strait hat-tipped included <a href=#>Johnny Cash </a>("Folsom Prison Blues"&nbsp;during the encore), <a href=#>Waylon Jennings</a> (Waymore's Blues") and <a href=#>Merle Haggard</a>. In fact, he played three different songs from the Hag's catalog: "Misery and Gin," "Pancho and Lefty" and "The Fightin' Side of Me." Add it up and&nbsp;more than 20 percent of his show was cover songs.</p><p><a href=#>Little Big Town </a>and Stapleton — the 2023 ACM Entertainer of the Year — played before Strait, but the crowd was there for the King, who displayed the kind of steady hand and confidence he describes in songs like "Fireman," "I Got a Car" and "The Weight of the Badge." It was a no frills show, because no frills were needed.</p><h3>George Strait Nashville Setlist, Nissan Stadium — July 28, 2023:</h3><p>1. “Write This Down”<br>2. “I Got a Car”<br>3. “Fireman”<br>4. “How ‘Bout Them Cowgirls”<br>5. “Run”<br>6. “Here for a Good Time”<br>7. “I Can Still Make Cheyenne”<br>8. “Check Yes or No”<br>9. “That’s My Kind of Woman”<br>10. “Blue Clear Sky”<br>11. “Waymore Blues” (Waylon Jennings Cover)<br>12. “The Weight of the Badge”<br>13. “Ocean Front Property”<br>14. “She’ll Leave You With a Smile”<br>15. “When the Credits Roll”<br>16. “Misery and Gin” (Merle Haggard Cover)<br>17. “Pancho and Lefty” (Feat.

The country legend asked $6.9 million for his 7,925-square-foot home that includes three bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half-baths on a hilltop in a very exclusive area of San Antonio. The final selling price was not disclosed.</p><p>The house sits on 12.2 acres and includes a gourmet kitchen, separate his and her bathrooms and closets and 14 hand-sculpted masonry fireplaces. The main house is wired for surround sound throughout, and it also features outdoor living spaces including a patio with built-in grill, sink, icemaker and refrigerator. There's also an infinity pool/spa and a sports court, a workout room with a private bathroom and sauna, and a walk-in safe room.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJ2fp7SmedKtqZqhpGK7or%2FHr6ClpJVisLC6wp6prWWimsOqsdZmqp6sXaG2tMCO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./quote-machine-57-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Megan Fox Is Not Really Concerned With Convincing People That Shes Smart (Unlike Scarlett Johanss">&larr;
