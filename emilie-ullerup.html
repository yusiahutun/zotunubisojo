Since then, Emilie has made a name for herself both on and off the small screen, and has overcome a major health challenge to get to where she is today.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Ullerup is quickly rising through the ranks of Hallmark royalty, and you can catch her next film, Retreat to You, on September 23 at 8/7c alongside Peter Mooney, who you might also recognize from Hallmark’s Fly Away with Me!</p><p>(Read about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Mooney, the handsome new Hallmark star, here!</a>)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/RetreatToYou_0204_RT.jpg.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Emilie Ullerup breaks into the industry</h2><p>Ullerup’s earliest role came in 2006 for two episodes of Battlestar Galactica as Julia Brynn. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">That was my very first audition,</a>” she told Pop Culture Principle. “Battlestar Galactica was a huge hit show and it ran smoothly and everyone was so professional, so for me as a first time experience, it set the standard pretty high. At the same time, I had no idea what I was doing. It was overwhelming and terrifying, but a great experience because everything was just easy there. It was just lovely.”</p><p>Soon after, she did an eight-episode stint in Sanctuary, for which she played the role of Ashley Magnus, a character who, despite being controversial, received a lot of support in the wake of her being written out of the series.</p><p>“When you leave a show — I was very, very nervous that the forums would be extremely excited that Ashley was gone. I mean, you never know what people are going to feel,” she told Clique Clack. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">And seeing that it&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;that way was really exciting</a>.

While luckily benign, its removal was invasive and required removal of her&nbsp;coccyx&nbsp;and half of the&nbsp;sacrum&nbsp;of her&nbsp;pelvis.</p><p>“There were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">moments of great frustration and fear and lack of control,</a>” she told Clique Clack. “I think those are very healthy things to be faced with once in a while — as long as you can get out of it okay.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Emilie’s off-screen romance</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emilie Ullerup</a> is married to Kyle Cassie, another Canadian actor known for his work in Deadpool, Puppet Killer and Lost Boys: The Tribe.

I had to hold a lot of purses or my hands in front of me to camouflage the bump. You could make a&nbsp;drinking game&nbsp;out of the movie: any time you spot the bump you drink.

I thought it was a lovely, lovely tale of a woman also learning to let go a little of the fears and the control issues she’s obviously put in place to protect herself [and] learning that maybe they’re not serving her anymore.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Retreat to You (2023)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/RetreatToYou_0001_RT.jpg.jpg><p>Catch Ullerup alongside Peter Mooney in her newest Hallmark film, Retreat to You, which follows two high school ex-best friends that cross paths once again in a chance meeting at a wilderness retreat.
