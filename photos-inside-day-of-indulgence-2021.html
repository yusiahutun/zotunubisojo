In pure JLo style, she accessorized with oversized shades and thin gold hoops. Emme, meanwhile, matched her mom's vibe in a crochet knit sweater, a white crop top, and casual printed pants.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two were all smiles during the event as they picked up a ton of goodies, including a sweet surprise for Ben Affleck's children at the Made by Mary booth. Lopez asked for birth month necklaces for his daughters, and mentioned that she was heading to Ben's home that evening to celebrate his birthday, and wanted to bring them a special gift.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">JLo also picked up a birth month necklace for herself, saying that lotus was "her flower," and Emme got one, too. Lopez also grabbed a pair of pink bluelight frames and lavender No sleep sunnies from Quay, as well as Kinship's new Supermelt Vegan Lip Jelly Mask and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Brightwave Brightening Eye Cream</a>. Emme also took home a set of Kinship skincare for her brother, Max.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The duo also scooped up Benefit Cosmetics new brow Powmade, and JLo had her face sprayed with the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Porefessional Super Setter</a>, which was a major hit at the event.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want this all in my bathroom," Lopez said as she went on to fill a tote with every product at the Fresh booth, including a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Brown Sugar Scrub</a> and Hesperides Grapefruit Bath and Shower Gel, before sitting down to sip a bottle of Hubble watermelon water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Ashley Park went into total fangirl mode when she tried on a Veronica Beard suit and Lopez complimented her look. "She said I looked powerful. I have to get this suit," Park said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Yep, that's Laverne Cox inside this futuristic face shield.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Per usual there was a chance to indulge at every corner, and Laverne Cox grabbed a bag of sweet treats from See's Candies as she dished on her <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>multicolored face shield</a> that everyone was raving over. "When I walked in, I told JLo, I'm doing the high-low thing. The purse is Fendi, the belt is Louis Vuitton, the bodysuit is Mugler, the shoes are Balenciaga and then <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Amazon.com</a>," she said with a laugh. "I got it for $15."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All attendees were required to wear masks, and the event was mainly held outside. In the inside shopping rooms, only one to two guests were allowed in at a time. There were also Touchland hand sanitizer stations and baskets of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mrs. Meyer's Hand sanitizers</a> at every turn.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Flowermaid arrangements of yellow roses, marigolds, and sunflowers and Nest diffusers made for a comfortable ambiance, while sanitizers added a different kind of comfort.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We're living in a time that is so unpredictable and I felt like it was my responsibility to bring back the fun to the ladies this year in a safe way," Klein, who wore a printed Veronica Beard dress and Sam Edelman shoes, told InStyle. And guests had no problem with the mask-and-distance MO.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think that in one year we've all learned to live with this," Christina Hendricks said. "Masks are not as difficult, being social where we know how to sort of keep our distance, and be safe. It's a very respectful group, so everyone's keeping their eye out for one another, being polite, being kind and it feels like a safe place."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was clear that the ability to relax and enjoy themselves a bit was more than appreciated. "It's overwhelming in the best way," Insecure's Yvonne Orji said. "There's beautiful people and you get all these goodies, and I think everyone is just ready to be indulging in goodness and wellness and excited to get out of the house." It was Orji's first time at the annual event, and she wore a yellow tank top paired with a brown blazer, matching shorts, and quilted heels. She picked up a pair of Quay shades she wore for the rest of the day, even as she kicked back for a massage.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Inside, Cynthia Erivo slipped out of her balloon-bedecked corduroys, Black Is King T-shirt, and Fruition hat, and had a dance party as she tried on clothes from Veronica Beard and GANNI. She went home with a bag from Sam Edelman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Ruth Negga raved about TKEES' cute loungewear that was on offer. "I'm obsessed with those jumpsuits and the Made by Mary necklaces. Mary is my middle name," she said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jordana Brewster and Tyra Banks swooned over the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>new suede leggings</a> in neutral hues at Spanx's booth. Banks went full out to support her ice cream brand, SMiZE Cream, which guests noshed on toward the end of the event. She was wearing the brand's tee shirt and a necklace, too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beauty was king, though, and attendees had loads of splurge-worthy products and treatments to try. "Most of the products here are all clean and all about inclusivity and self-expression, which is really important to me," said Julianne Hough, who wore a black floral Reformation dress said, sipping Le Grand Courtage. She added that she considered the event an opportunity to network and spark new collaborations.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm really excited about Kinship because my company's name is Kinergy, and it's all about community and connection." The Safe Haven star also picked up a Radley London handbag and a pair of red <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Ma'am</a> "Ruth" sandals that she loved so much, she walked out of the event in them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yvonne Orji and Dania Ramirez sniffed scents at Atelier Cologne's booth, before taking home their favorites in customized bottles, and both grabbed Makeup Junkie cult-classic makeup bags and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixi's Glow Tonic</a>, after stopping by the new Halo42 wellness brand's booth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tessa Thompson, who told us she went with a "summer garden theme" for her chic vintage ensemble, grabbed a bag of Garrett Popcorn on her way out after enjoying a massage with Caudalie products. Hendricks got a pedicure with Nails Inc. polish, and Orji enjoyed Tatcha treatments and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">SkinMedica Eye Bright Masks</a> by the pool.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Guests were treated to individually wrapped Tocaya burritos that made it easy to grab and go, Wise Sons bagels, and Bristol Farms salads and sandwiches, all individually wrapped for safety, Klein explained. Olivia Rodrigo, Leslie Mann and Mann's daughters Maude and Iris Apatow all arrived together, and munched on the burritos. "Omg the food was so good," Olivia said, as they headed out toting tons of products from Fresh. The Mann-Apatow clan, as well as Jennifer Lopez and Emme all had sweet mother-daughter moments shopping in the Marine Layer room.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>To wash down all these snacks, servers passed JNSQ rosé, Spindrift hard seltzers, SZENT scented water, Olipop soda, Elements, CANN, and Taja coconut water. Cynthia Erivo said she loved Evian's wellness-boosting sparkling waters.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Erivo raved about the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Smart Sweets</a> on hand. "That's a favorite thing, because it doesn't have too much sugar, and it's a whole bag of sweets, which has the effect for me," she said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cobie Smulders enjoyed the mini Nothing Bundt Cakes, Nicole Scherzinger noshed on Crumbl cookies and Toodaloo trail mix, and Natasha Rothwell and Orji toasted a Don Julio mini cocktail and Le Grand Courtage, respectively, from one of the passed trays.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other guests, like Alexandra Shipp, treated themselves to Moroccanoil reflexology massages, hand and foot massages with Bluemercury, iS Clinical, and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">EO products</a>, RéVive eye treatments, and Milk + Honey mini-massages.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>As guests headed out, there were more snacks at the door to take home: Gimme Organics seaweed snack packs, Barney Butter almond butter, Pipcorn, Clio Yogurt Bars, and Baked by Melissa sweets. They also enjoyed Shake Shack milkshakes and Coffee Bean cold brew to power up for their drives home.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Graves</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the icing on the proverbial cake was the luxe <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Samsonite suitcases</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>LeSportSac weekender bags</a> guests took home. "I'm so excited about the suitcases," Ramirez said as she waited for hers. They were filled with even more products, including Madewell jeans, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>NuFACE Trinity devices</a>, Jabra clear headphones, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Livemore Organics</a>, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel=nofollow>Therabody's New Wave duo</a>, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel=nofollow>Asics new Gel Kayano running shoes</a>, and more. Perhaps the biggest win of the day? Guests took home gift certificates to the Peninsula Beverly Hills and PS at LAX, which gives them access to a private airport terminal and luxury amenities before and after their flights. After a year-plus of pandemic living, stretching the indulgence way past one day makes perfect sense.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8%2Bhpq2no2K2r7%2FInZxmnJGuerCyjKKlna2cnLKvr8RmaWlqYQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./543937-govt-admits-existence-fake-fertiliser-market-days-mithika-linturis-denial.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gov't Admits Existence of Fake Fertiliser in Market Days after CS Mithika Linturi's Denial">&larr;
