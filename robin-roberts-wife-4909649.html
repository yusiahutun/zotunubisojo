She was also the first woman of color and the first out LGBT woman to host the show, Jeopardy!&nbsp;However, when Robin is not busy telling the news on TV or writing best-selling books, she is often spending time with her partner,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Amber Laign</strong></a>. Below is everything to know about her, their relationship — including 2023 wedding plans — and their life together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Robin-Roberts-Wife-Amber-MEGA-embed.jpg><h2>Is Robin Roberts Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Although the&nbsp;Everybody’s Got Something&nbsp;author has been in a relationship with Amber for many years, they are not legally married — however, it appears that will change in 2023. On <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jan. 2’s&nbsp;Good Morning America</a>, Robin confirmed that she’s “saying yes to marriage” this year. “We’re getting married this year,” she said to author<strong> Gabrielle Bernstein</strong>, revealing that the couple have “talked about” walking down the aisle, however, “put it off” when Amber was battling breast cancer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Robin has been in a relationship with Amber since 2005, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The US Sun</a>, but it wasn’t until 2013 that Robin openly came out as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LGBT</a>. “I am grateful for my entire family, my longtime girlfriend, Amber, and friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together,” she wrote via Facebook in Dec. 2013.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Later, in 2014, the TV host came out on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GMA&nbsp;</a>for the first time. “I’m going to tell you all this, and you know because you’ve had a front-row seat to the tumultuous year I’ve had,” Robin said, in part, at the time. “I have never been happier or healthier than I am right now.” She later thanked her girlfriend Amber for supporting her through “a very difficult year.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Most recently, Robin took to X (Twitter) to seemingly confirm her and Amber’s wedding date. “T-Minus 1 week till the big day…of course I still find time to say #RabbitRabbit Blessings to all this month & always,” she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> on Sept. 1, 2023. And nearly two weeks prior, she took to Instagram to share <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> from her bachelorette weekend. “This is what being blissfully content looks like….ohhhhh what a night! #bacheloretteweekend,” Robin captioned the photo of herself inside of the car.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>T-Minus 1 week till the big day…of course I still find time to say <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#RabbitRabbit</a> 😉 Blessings to all this month & always.🙏🏾❤️</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>— Robin Roberts (@RobinRoberts) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 1, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Earlier, on Aug. 20, 2023, she shared a couple more <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> from the celebratory weekend. “Thnx [sic] to my amazing, fun #bridetribe my #bacheroletteweekend was truly…lit! Before Sweet Amber left on her bachelorette weekend she insisted that I venture outside my comfort zone and really let loose. So glad I followed her advice and so glad I have an extra day to recover! See you Tuesday on @goodmorningamerica. I’ll be the one with the huge on my face, filled with gratitude. Hope you had a memorable weekend too,” she gushed in the caption.</p><h2>Who Is Amber Laign?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Amber is more than just Robin’s girlfriend, but she’s also a businesswoman.&nbsp;The blonde beauty is a massage therapist, as well as the founder of Plant Juice Oils, an essential oils brand. “Natural products for busy women wanting to take control of their health for their wellbeing,” the company’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram bio</a> reads.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>In addition, Amber is frequently spotted on the company social media account promoting her oils, which hope to help women with “Menopause Support.” On Oct. 18, 2022, Amber shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a video</a> on the account to discuss World Menopause Day. “Happy World Menopause Day. Can you believe there is a full day for us?”, the entrepreneur quipped.</p><h2>Their Relationship & What Robin Has Said</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>It is important to note that, both Robin and Amber are both cancer survivors, as the 62-year-old was diagnosed with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breast cancer</a> in 2007, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cure Today</a>.&nbsp;And on July 18, 2022, the&nbsp;From the Heart&nbsp;author took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to congratulate her girlfriend on completing her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cancer treatment</a>. “Sweet Amber completing radiation, a very important phase of her treatment! We both thank you for all your well wishes and prayers. Proud of her and all fellow Thrivers for your grit and grace during a challenging time. This is indeed my #mondaymotivation,” Robin captioned the video of Amber ringing a bell in celebration.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>In 2014, Robin appeared on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>&nbsp;to talk about why she didn’t come out for many years, despite having been with Amber since 2005. “Not everybody wants to be in the spotlight,” the journalist said. “She’s very very supportive, she’s been right there beside me every step of the way.” Later, in the interview, Robin said she had been thanking her medical team and friends for their support, and she also wanted to publicly thank her girlfriend, Amber. “And I asked her [Amber], ‘I really want to say thank you.'” Robin also opened up further about their relationship in her book,&nbsp;Everybody’s Got Something.</p><h2>The Couple Celebrate Their 18 Year Romance On ‘GMA’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>The private couple both appeared on Robin’s show&nbsp;Good Morning America&nbsp;in August 2023 in a special segment dubbed <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Road To The Ring</a>” as they counted down to their wedding. In a taped piece, the duo recounted the early years of their relationship — including their blind date.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>“Our two friends, my friend Alex, her friend Bert, finally said, ‘Enough, you two are going to meet,'” Amber remembered of the first introduction. “I remember just walking up and she’s just beautiful, and she took my breath away, and she still does,” she recalled.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Robin echoed similar sentiments.&nbsp;“Within a few minutes [of the date], I was kicking my friend Bert under the table,” the longtime news anchor added. “And we asked if they would like to stay for dinner, and her friend couldn’t stay, but she did.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>Shortly after the date, Amber changed her morning commute to pass through Times Square to wave “hello” to her crush — eventually turned girlfriend.&nbsp;“I’d cut through Times Square and <strong>Sam [Champion]</strong> would be doing the weather,” Amber remembered. “And when Sam would do the weather, Robin would walk over to the windows and she’d wave and we would time it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>For Robin, it was something she looked forward to each morning.&nbsp;“It just put a little extra pep in my step. I don’t know how we finally got the timing down, but that went on for quite a while…I do remember looking forward to that time in the morning when she would walk by and I could just go, I’d just run [to the window].”</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>The couple also opened up about being there for each other during hardships — including Robin’s breast cancer just two years into their relationship, and Amber losing her father.</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>“We had only been dating not even two years when I was diagnosed with breast cancer,” Robin explained “She could have bailed early on in the relationship. No one would have blamed her…She’s so kind. She’s just really, really kind, and it’s so genuine, you know? It’s not trying to be anything other than who she is,” she&nbsp; said of her wife to be.</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>“It can either tear you apart or bring you closer together, and thank the good Lord, it brought us closer together,” Robin went on. “We are partners. We will do whatever it takes, and I think that the illnesses that we have gone through, and are going through, have only strengthened us and made us more compassionate with each other and have a better understanding of each other.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>The ABC host also revealed that they’ve had their ups and downs — revealing that their hardships sought them to seek couples counseling as they “fought” to stay together. “There was no piece of paper. There was no reason why we had to stay,” Robin confessed. “We could have walked away at any time, and we didn’t.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>During the interview, Robin and Amber revealed that they had a far from traditional proposal once they decided to tie the knot in 2022 following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>“We took the calamari rings and we slapped them on each other’s fingers and we just we proposed to one another,” Robin said. “Now looking back, it was pretty fitting for us to not have a down on one knee [proposal] and one person doing it and who was going to propose. It was just us hanging out in our little hole-in-the-wall Mexican spot and putting calamari rings on each other and saying, ‘Let’s go. Let’s do it.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-34>Amber also shared her feelings to Robin’s suggestion they make their union legal. “When she said, ‘Let’s get married,’ the feeling that I got was a rush of excitement, nervousness, of course … and happy,” she gushed. “We had planned on getting married last year, but then I was diagnosed [with breast cancer] … so this was like perfect timing, saying it on air.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GomaKmXae8o7HRrapmr5mbsm6AmGlwb2xpZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./unique-celebrity-baby-names-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Most Unique Celebrity Baby Names Of 2023">&larr;
