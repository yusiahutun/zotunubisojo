He has a busy, although not gruelling, &nbsp;tour schedule ahead, singing &nbsp;in Budapest, Prague, Phoenix, Las Vegas and New York’s Madison Square Garden up to the end &nbsp;of the year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/10/16/us_pope_francis_oss105.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bocelli’s new album, &nbsp;Cinema, &nbsp;which goes on global release on October 23, is his first &nbsp;in two years &nbsp;and encapsulates a lifelong love of film music.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 16 tracks &nbsp;include classics like Maria from West Side Story, Moon River from Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and The Music of the Night from The Phantom of the Opera.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bocelli invited in young talent on a couple of the songs, teaming up with Ariana Grande for E Piu’ Ti Penso from Once Upon a Time in America, and Nicole Scherzinger for a rousing duet of No Llores Por Mi, Argentina (Don’t Cry for Me Argentina).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The songs featured &nbsp;are in &nbsp;English, Italian, French, Spanish and the dialect of Sicily. &nbsp;Por una Cabeza, the beguiling tango song that appeared in 1992’s Scent of a Woman, is in Spanish – “a wonderfully seductive, evocative language”, he &nbsp;says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2015/10/16/bocelli_cinema.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bocelli – who &nbsp;suffered from congenital glaucoma as a child and &nbsp;lost his sight for good after an accident during a soccer &nbsp;match when he was 12 – considered hundreds of songs before settling on the final tracks, choosing songs that are beloved and admired.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The basic principle that I’ve followed in choosing these pieces is that they have established themselves over space and time,” he &nbsp;says. &nbsp;“This is music that is very touching. The music of a film score allows composers to go out in space and be totally free. They don’t have to follow any &nbsp;established patterns … &nbsp;It’s not a constraining type of music.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has long been inspired by composers like Ennio Morricone, Henry Mancini and Leonard Bernstein. And it’s not just those &nbsp;mainstream composers that he remembers as being a profound influence on his musicianship. He likes to cite Italian operatic bass singer Bonaldo Giaiotti, &nbsp;who was born and grew up near the Dolomite mountains in northeastern Italy, &nbsp;and who &nbsp;believes that “even cows mooing” can &nbsp;be a source of inspiration.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;“Any voice that comes from nature can relax and put you in harmony,” &nbsp;says Bocelli.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/10/16/000_was4250311.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The classical tenor &nbsp;made his first foray into pop music &nbsp;in the late &nbsp;1990s, after the success of his award-winning duet with Celine Dion, The Prayer, &nbsp;on &nbsp;the Quest for Camelot soundtrack. &nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His voice can be both &nbsp;vigorous and velvety at the same time; when Bocelli sings he conveys intimacy, pathos, longing. His breakthrough 1995 hit, Con Te Partiro, &nbsp;which was done partly in English a year later with Sarah Brightman as Time to Say Goodbye, &nbsp;has on numerous occasions brought Bocelli himself to tears, as well as the legions of people that have heard him sing it in concert halls around the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;Bocelli says he forms a connection with each song he undertakes. “In order for an artist to understand a song, it has to be in his nature, part of his DNA,” &nbsp;the tenor says. “Basically an artist is an artist because he has a very strong desire to understand the almost cryptic nature which is contained in a piece of music.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;Although Bocelli began taking piano lessons when he was six, and later &nbsp;learned the flute and saxophone, &nbsp;&nbsp;a career in music was the last thing on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mind. He grew up on a farm in rural Tuscany where, &nbsp;he says, “it wasn’t like there was a lot of singing at home from my mother and grandmother”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;“The moment that records came into existence, they took over. We listened to them &nbsp;24 hours a day.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;He decided to study law, getting his degree at the University of Pisa, and says that if &nbsp;a career in music hadn’t worked out, he would have become an attorney. But instead, he went on to study with the tenor Franco Corelli, &nbsp;and gigged in piano bars to support himself.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">You listen to things when you’re young that you &nbsp;realise later are kind of naive. But then other songs, they are works of artAndrea Bocelli</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;In 1992, he auditioned to record a duet with Luciano Pavarotti, was selected, and went on to perform as a guest star in the Pavarotti International Festival. &nbsp;International acclaim followed very soon afterwards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His first two albums, from 1994 and 1996, showed his operatic chops. It wasn’t until his fourth album, Romanza, which included the Brightman duet, that Bocelli began to be regarded as a crossover artist. When&nbsp;The Prayer came out in 1998, that reputation was solidified after Bocelli was nominated for a Grammy for &nbsp;best new artist; the song won a Golden Globe award, and sold 10 &nbsp;million copies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;“As time goes on, your tastes start to change,” &nbsp;he says. “You listen to things when you’re young that you &nbsp;realise later are kind of naive. But then other songs, they are works of art – listened to and appreciated throughout the world, throughout time.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite decades of &nbsp;performing in &nbsp;sold-out stadiums and arenas, he says he still often walks onto a stage with a little trepidation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/10/16/063_477132322.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every time I go close to [singing] an opera, I have a feeling that I might not be able to take it to its end,” he &nbsp;says. “There’s definitely that angst every time. Doubt is a very important component of success. I don’t think there’s an artist anywhere that isn’t animated by doubt.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bocelli also believes that there is no magic formula for success. He often talks about artistic talent being something that is God-given, and indeed says that his own voice comes “from above”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Art has to do with being a gift from God,” he says. “You can be an excellent engineer or architect or worker in a factory. But if you didn’t get the gift, I truly don’t believe that that person could become an artist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Conversely, if what I say is true, it’s also true that no matter how much you work, if you don’t have that gift you cannot be successful. But if you do have the gift, you have to work very, very hard to be a good artist. The concept of good fortune or good opportunity – that’s a consolation prize for those people who weren’t able to make it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmnKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BWv7W1wqWcaGloa4V1f5homKecopqubq7OnJylpJlitKrCxKxkr6eZmLJutMisZKWnppp6p7XLpmSmraOesG6vyKecppk%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lea-swanson-named-talent-buyer-at-mountain-winery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lea Swanson Named Talent Buyer At Mountain Winery">&larr;
