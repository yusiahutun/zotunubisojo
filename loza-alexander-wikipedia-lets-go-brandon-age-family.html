And questions related to his family.</p><p>Scroll down, as this Loza Alexander Wikipedia brings you information on his family, his wife and son, and his real name.</p><h3><strong>Meet Loza Alexander, The Rapper Behind The Viral Song “Let’s Go Brandon”</strong></h3><p>Loza Alexander, a rapper from New Jersey, went viral with his hit song, “Let’s Go Brandon.” The song had quite an impact as an internet meme but then it hit the iTunes hip-hop charts and got everyone’s attention. The trend went viral following NASCAR star Brandon Brown’s interview with NBC reporter Kelli Stavast.</p><p>The journalist with mistake interpreted “F*** Joe Biden” as “Let’s Go Brandon.” At the time of this writing, the song sat on the second spot on the iTunes Hip Hop chart. Whereas the song gathered 2.04 million views as of this writing.</p><p>The viral rapper also released a video with Brandon being interviewed behind.</p><h3><strong>Loza Alexander Age</strong></h3><p>As of October 2021, Loza Alexander was age 33.</p><h3><strong>Loza Alexander Family</strong></h3><p>Loza Alexander was born to his father Brian Loza and his mother Wanda Alexander. While he kept his parents away from social media, he could never stop boasting about his parents on his Twitter. In July 2019, he was thankful to his mother and father for giving him the best childhood anyone could imagine having.</p><p>Furthermore, the rapper also credited his parents for the reason he became a family man. He couldn’t stop tweeting about his mom, as he was the closest to her. “I love my mom so much it’s unreal… She is the most amazing person in my life and she has been helping me out and..,” Loza tweeted on 1 November 2013.</p><p>Whereas, as an artist, Loza shared that he only wanted to make songs to make his mom happy and couldn’t care less about anyone else.</p><p>Furthermore, Loza is one of the two children born to Brian and Wanda. He has a sister named Brittney Loza who he loves dearly. Going by his tweets, he is also very close to his beloved sister.</p><p>Besides his parents and his sister, Loza also shared about his cousin who had a horrible death at the age of 6. But, since his cousin’s mom didn’t care much about the death of her child, Loza hated her guts.</p><h3><strong>Does Loza Alexander Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Loza Alexander is a divorced father. He and the love of his life (whose name he never gave away) married on 12 October 2013. On 13 October he tweeted, “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">I am now a married man… No more girlfriend crap I use to deal with lol… I finally found my soul mate. We made… </span><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir=ltr role=link href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-hiw28u r-qvk6io r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" aria-hidden=true>http://</span>FB.me/18a0RJu8V</a>.” A month later, a then-newly married couple ended up getting an apartment together.</p><p>Before marrying her, he even made a song for her.</p><p>Together, Loza and his ex-wife welcomed a son named Akai King Loza on 18 March 2014.
