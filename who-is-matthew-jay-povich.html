Mathew’s mom, Connie Chung, has been a news anchor and reporter for U.S. news networks such as ABC, CBS, and CNN. Since the cradle of American civilization, Chung has been a reporter and has contributed significantly to American journalism history.&nbsp;</p><p>His father, Maury Povich, is famous for his tabloid talk show which aired from 1991 to 2022. He was initially a radio reporter at WWDC before he became a TV personality. Maury gained prominence as the host of a tabloid infotainment TV show, “A Current Affair.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-2_14_30_29.jpg><p>Chung and Maury’s success made their fans curious about Matthew Jay Povich. So who is he?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Maury_Povichs_Son></span>Who Is Maury Povich’s Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chung and Maury adopted Matthew Jay Povich on June 20, 1995. He is the only child of his parents, as the pair do not have biological children together. His parents named him Mathew Jay, which was also his baptismal name. Although the famous couple adopted Mathew, his birthdate and birthplace are unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>Like details of his birth, his educational background and achievements also remain a mystery. However, we can confirm that the celebrity child had a normal upbringing like most kids. Due to his parent’s financial status, we can assume that Matthew Jay Povich enjoyed numerous childhood privileges.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Matthew_Jay_Povich_Has_Two_Step-Siblings></span>Matthew Jay Povich Has Two Step-Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Mathew’s parents did not have a child together, his father has two daughters from his previous marriage to Phyllis Minkoff. Maury and his ex-wife tied the knot in 1962 and had two daughters, Susan Anne and Amy Joyce Povich. Maury and Minkoff were together for over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, their marriage crashed in 1979, seeing the pair go their separate ways. The team remained co-parents to their daughters and were both involved in the upbringing of their girls. Although there is limited information about Mathew Jay Povich’s step-sisters, reports claim that Amy is married to a physician, David Agus.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-2_14_31_56.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Matthews_Father_Cheat_on_His_Mom></span>Did Matthew’s Father Cheat on His Mom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Maury and Chung reportedly adopted Mathew from a young single mother in California. The story behind Matthew Jay Povich’s adoption led to speculation, and several fans wondered if there was more to it. As a result, many fans believed that Maury may have cheated on his wife and fathered a child out of wedlock.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, Empire News featured a scripted parody claiming that Maury was Mathew’s biological father. In the article, an angry viewer challenged Maury to take a DNA test. He took the test, and the results proved Matthew Jay Povich was Maury’s son. According to the script, Maury later disclosed that he donated his sperm several years ago for quick cash.</p><p>Despite the uproar that followed, Maury and his wife neither confirmed the rumors nor debunked them. The claims are unconfirmed, and the allegations remain what they are, just words.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-2_14_31_13.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Connie_Chungs_Son_In_a_Relationship></span>Is Connie Chung’s Son In a Relationship?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite being the only son of two iconic celebrities, Matthew Jay Povich has lived out of the spotlight. He has been secretive about his relationships, and there is no information about any past relationships he has been in. Hence, he is officially single. However, like most of his peers, there’s a chance Matthew Jay Povich has been in one or two relationships.</p><p>Mathew has chosen to live a quiet life away from his parent’s fame. While his life continues to spark interest among his parent’s fans, he does not seem to care much for the spotlight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Matthew_Jay_Povich_a_Journalist></span>Is Matthew Jay Povich a Journalist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he is not. The celebrity child has not anchored the news for any known station like his mother, nor has he hosted any shows like his father. Hence, Mathew Jay Povich’s career is unknown. He has not graced the screens like his parents.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_His_Net_Worth></span>What Is His Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Several reports claim that Jay has a net worth of $1,000,000. However, these reports are unverifiable. Since Matthew Jay Povich does not have a known source of income, his net worth cannot be verified. Hence, his net worth is unknown. However, his parents have a net worth of $80,000,000.</p><p>Like Morris Chestnut’s son, <a href=#>Grant Chestnut</a>, Matthew Jay Povich has prioritized his privacy over the immense opportunities his parent’s fame would get him.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqWRqcGpsdZmoZqxXaW8t7XCoWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jane-fonda-gagosian-benefit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jane Fonda and the Art World Take On Big Oil">&larr;
