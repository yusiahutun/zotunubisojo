So what is <a href=# id=auto-tag_taylor-swift data-tag=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</a>‘s Eras Tour set list? After months of guesses and anticipation, we have our answer.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Eras Tour</a> is Swift’s sixth headlining concert tour following the Fearless Tour in 2009 and 2010; the Speak Now World Tour in 2011 and 2012; The Red Tour in 2013 and 2014; The 1989 World Tour in 2015; and the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. Swift was set to perform on her sixth concert tour, Lover Fest, in 2020, however the tour was postponed and eventually cancelled in February 2021 due to the current health crisis.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reba-mcentire-taylor-swift.jpg><p>“I love coming on here to tell you good news, or to share a new project with you,” she wrote on her social media accounts. “It’s not my favorite thing in the world to have to tell you news I’m sad about. I’m so sorry, but I cannot reschedule the shows that we’ve postponed. Although refunds have been available since we first postponed the Lover Fest shows, many of you hung onto your tickets and I too hung onto the idea that we could reschedule,” she wrote on her social media at the time. “This is an unprecedented pandemic that has changed everyone’s plans and no one knows what the touring landscape is going to look like in the near future. I’m so disappointed that I won’t be able to see you in person as soon as I wanted to. I miss you terribly and can’t wait til we can all safely be at shows together again.”</p><p>Swift announced The Eras Tour in November 2022. The tour—which was announced less than two weeks after the release of her most recent album, <a href=# rel=noopener>Midnights</a>—is a “journey through the musical eras” of Swift’s past 10 albums: 2006’s Taylor Swift; 2008’s Fearless;&nbsp;2010’s Speak Now;&nbsp;2012’s Red; 2014’s 1989; 2017’s Reputation;&nbsp;2019’s Lover;&nbsp;2020’s Folklore and Evermore;&nbsp;and 2022’s Midnights.&nbsp;Due to the current health crisis, Swift’s most recent four albums—Lover, Folklore, Evermore and <a href=# rel=noopener>Midnights</a>—will be performed on tour for the first time on The Eras Tour.</p><p>But back to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour set list.

The first leg of the tour will be in stadiums across the US, with international dates to be announced as soon as we can! Feeling like the luckiest person alive because I get to take these brilliant artists out on tour with me: @paramore, @radvxz, @phoebebridgers, @girlinred, @whereismuna, @haimtheband, @gracieabrams, @gayle and @owennmusic. I can’t WAIT to see your gorgeous faces out there. It’s been a long time coming 🥰</p><p>In a TikTok comment in November 2022, Swift confirmed that “Delicate,” her third single from Reputation, will be on the set list for The Eras Tour. The confirmation came after a TikTok user named Alex posted a video of her singing along to 2018 clip of Swift performing “Delicate” on her Reputation Tour. “Petition to bring this back for eras tour,” the user wrote on the video. Swift responded in the comments with “Done.”</p><p>Given that Swift hasn’t had a tour to promote her most recent four albums—Lover, Folklore, Evermore and Midnights—fans expect The Eras Tour to lean more on these records, especially Midnights, which was released less than two weeks before Swift announced The Eras Tour. In an Instagram post in October 2022, Swift explained that Midnights consisted of 13 songs written in the “middle of the night.” “We lie awake in love and in fear, in turmoil and in tears. We stare at walls and drink until they speak back. We twist in our self-made cages and pray that we aren’t—right this minute—about to make some fateful life-altering mistake,” she wrote. “This is a collection of <a href=# id=auto-tag_music-2 data-tag=music-2>music</a> written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams. The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching—hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve…we’ll meet ourselves.” She continued in a tweet at the time, “Midnights is a collage of intensity, highs and lows and ebbs and flows. Life can be dark, starry, cloudy, terrifying, electrifying, hot, cold, romantic or lonely. Just like Midnights.”</p><p>At 3 a.m. ET on October 21, 2022, three hours after the release of Midnights, Swift announced that she released seven more songs as part of a deluxe version of the album&nbsp; titled Midnights (3am Edition). “Surprise! I think of Midnights as a complete concept album, with those 13 songs forming a full picture of the intensities of that mystifying, mad hour. However! There were other songs we wrote on our journey to find that magic 13,” she tweeted at the time. She accompanied the tweet with a post that explained that the time 3 a.m. means to her. “What keeps you up at night? It’s a momentary glimmer of distraction,” she wrote. “The tiniest notion of reminiscent thought that wanders off into wondering, the spark that lights a tinderbox of fixation. And now it is irreversible. The flame has caught. You’re wide awake.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-are-taylor-swift-s-the-eras-tour-dates>What are Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour dates?</h2><p>What are Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour dates?

acts?</h2><p>Taylor Swift’s The Eras opening acts include Paramore, Phoebe Bridgers, Haim, GAYLE, Gracie Abrams and more artists. Two of Swift’s The Eras Tour opening acts have been featured on her songs: Haim, who was featured on the “No Body, No Crime” from Swift’s 2020 album Evermore; and Phoebe Bridgers, who was featured on “Nothing New” from her 2021 album Red (Taylor’s Version). “I got this random text from Aaron Dessner that was really weirdly worded for him,” she said. “And I was like, ‘What the fuck is this?’ And as I was reading it, I [realised], ‘Oh, my God, it’s from Taylor Swift,'” Bridgers told <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a> in 2022. “We started texting about all kinds of stuff. It was just a total high. It felt like when you meet someone at a party and you’re in the corner all night being like, ‘Me too!’”.</p><p>See the full list of Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour opening acts below.</p><ul><li>Paramore</li><li><span class=s1>beabadoobee</span></li><li><span class=s1>Phoebe Bridgers</span></li><li><span class=s1>girl in red</span></li><li><span class=s1>MUNA</span></li><li><span class=s1>Haim</span></li><li><span class=s1>GAYLE</span></li><li><span class=s1>Gracie Abrams</span></li><li><span class=s1>OWENN</span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Taylor-Swift-Eras-Tour-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-to-buy-taylor-swift-tickets>Where to buy Taylor Swift tickets</h2><p><span class=s1>Where can fans buy Taylor Swift tickets to The Eras Tour?
