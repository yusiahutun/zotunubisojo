You will find that adding your pick of these effective and potent face washes to your daily skincare routine can be a relief.&nbsp;</p><p>The appearance of blackheads is often beyond our control. They are caused by pores that get clogged up with dead skin cells and sebum. Our contributor Dr. Zeeshan Afzal, Health Content Advisor - Welzo, an online healthcare platform, says, “Blackheads are primarily caused by the accumulation of sebum (oil), dead skin cells, and debris in hair follicles. When this material is exposed to air, it oxidizes and turns black, resulting in blackheads.”&nbsp;Once that gunk in your pores meets the open air, it turns black. The good news is you can fight back. And no, you don't need fancy tools or a professional facial. All you need is an effective face wash specially formulated for the purpose.</p><p>We have completed the shortlisting process for your convenience<strong>. </strong>Through our trial and error, we discovered the products that really work.
