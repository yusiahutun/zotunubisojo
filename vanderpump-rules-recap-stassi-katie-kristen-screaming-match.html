Monday's <strong><a href=#>"Vanderpump Rules"</a></strong> was messy.</p><p>Well, not all of it. <strong><a href=#>Stassi Schroeder</a></strong> met Beau's mom, and the two hit it off. We've seriously never seen her so happy. Oh, and <strong><a href=#>Lala Kent</a></strong> made up with <strong><a href=#>Randall Emmett</a></strong>.

She agreed to come over and give the group relationship advice because, as Stassi pointed out, her friends need all the help they can get.</p><p>ICYMI: Kristen had a <strong><a href=#>drunken meltdown</a></strong> a few episodes back while the girls were all in Solvang. Stassi and Katie ended up revealing a lot of stuff about Kristen's relationship she had confided in them individually, but never as a group or in front of cameras. They said Kristen constantly tells them she's miserable, that her and Carter fight all the time, that he doesn't pay for anything and that he's just an overall flop of a dude.</p><p>This week, Katie revealed that Kristen and Carter don't have sex, let alone sleep in the same bed. Kristen couldn't refute it, but she was visibly uncomfortable. Naturally, word got back to Carter that the girls were railing on him, so he confronted them about it during Monday's new hour. He found them sitting and chatting in his and Kristen's bedroom, away from the big group that was sitting in the living room.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8127eb7f-1e8b-55cd-9354-be7d4fa11323 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5e04fad1-1ffb-5044-a627-ea9253cdbc9a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2019/02/27/7f5abccee52950cdbadb2527f0a7ddd0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">John Sessa Denies 'RHOBH' Conspiracy Theory Suggesting Lisa Vanderpump 'Planted' Dog Drama</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Taking a seat on the bed, Carter looked at Katie and said, "You and Tom have been together for what -- six, seven years?" Katie replied, "Eight years."</p><p>"Y'all have hit a little bit of lulls, a little bit of bad patches, and yet, you're still gonna grow," he said before turning his sights to Stassi. "You and Beau -- I'm so proud of you guys. Like, he's the best man ever, but I don't get why you guys have to bad-mouth me."</p><p>Katie maintained she was never talking smack about him, simply "regurgitating everything that [Kristen's] said." Carter insisted she and Stassi only ever hear "the bad stuff."</p><p>"Look me in the eye and tell me that you guys are in an awesome relationship!" Stassi shouted. "I have text messages [from Kristen] always saying, 'I need to get a Xanax. I need to get some weed. I need something because Carter's being mean to me.' For years."</p><p>Carter's tone changed instantly. "I'm getting relationship advice from someone who hasn't been in a good relationship until three months ago?" he fired back. Stassi didn't disagree.</p><p>"We have been dating for almost three years now, and there was a little rocky patch. I will admit that. I did not handle my shit right," Carter said. Before he could finish his thought, Stassi said she felt "uncomfortable" having such an intense conversation about her friend's relationship while sitting on her bed.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3fa7c126-0b76-5f1c-ba4e-89473073bdf2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5e04fad1-1ffb-5044-a627-ea9253cdbc9a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/87/5by4/2019/02/18/87599eb3512c57dc8199fd93b9de80a0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Vanderpump Rules' SURver Scuffle: Kristen Gets Trashed on Girls Trip Before Stassi Spills the Tea on Carter</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"You know what's awkward? Is sitting there and having to listen to Kristen be so upset, be miserable for so long, for the way you treat her!" Katie shouted.</p><p>That's when Carter shifted the blame to Stassi and Katie, telling them they're the reason he and Kristen don't get along. "You guys are f--king dicks to her," he said. "You guys are f--king rude. I'm sorry!"</p><p>Stassi and Katie were fuming. "She comes home and gets in fights with you because of me and Katie?!" Stassi asked Carter, looking for clarification.</p><p>"Because you guys are scary," he answered smugly. "Y'all scary."</p><p>When Kristen walked in to try to mediate, Stassi began loudly explaining to her what had just gone down.</p><p>"So No. 1, stop yelling in my house," she said calmly as she took a seat next to Carter.</p><p>"You guys do enough yelling here. I know. I get it," Katie fired back.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:25f7ba24-4dbb-5633-b5c1-2ee80a3d433c data-container-ref=toofab:article:5e04fad1-1ffb-5044-a627-ea9253cdbc9a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/77/5by4/2019/02/11/770a9c889d3a5a988f2cac64376b0bc5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Vanderpump Rules' SURver Scuffle: Jax and Brittany's Therapy Session Will Make You Cringe</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>No matter what Stassi and Katie tried to say, Kristen interrupted to tell them to lower their voices. Eventually, they snapped.</p><p>"Everything I said about him to you were things that you had said to me!" Katie said as she got into Kristen's face. Stassi added, "We are not making anything up, Kristen!"</p><p>Shocked, confused and "insulted," Katie left the apartment, as Kristen announced to her guests she was going to "sage this motherf--ker." Turns out the "motherf--ker" was Stassi.</p><p>"Kristen saged me!" Stassi shouted during a later confessional. "She saged me! Kristen has spent the first 35 years of her life in a blind, vengeful, drunken rage -- helicopter punching anyone who's in her path. Then she meets Beau's mom, and all of a sudden, she's Mohandas Gandhi and saging everyone in her apartment? Give me a f--king break."</p><p>Soon after, Stassi bid her goodbyes and left, too.</p><p>"Vanderpump Rules" airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
