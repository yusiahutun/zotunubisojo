Up ahead, we’ll take a walk down memory lane with <a href=#>Kate Middleton’s pregnant photos</a>, but first, let’s get to know the not-so-little-anymore kids of Cambridge.</p><p>Kate Middleton’s journey to motherhood began in 2012. After months of pregnancy rumors, the royal palace formally announced in December 2012 that she and her husband, Prince William, were expecting their first child. Kate, formally known as the Duchess of Cambridge at the time, didn’t have the easiest pregnancy—she was diagnosed with Hyperemesis Gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. “I was not the happiest pregnant person,” she later revealed in an episode of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Happy Mum, Happy Baby</a> podcast in February 2020. “I was really sick, I wasn’t eating the things I should be eating.”</p><p>Despite her difficult pregnancy, Kate went on to welcome a healthy baby boy, making her and Prince William parents for the very first time. Their son, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=192054>Prince George of Cambridge</a>, was born on July 22, 2013 and is currently heir to the British throne in the <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1715946>line of succession</a> after his father, Prince William. The future monarch was born at St. Mary’s Hospital in London—the same hospital where Prince William’s mother, Princess Diana, gave birth to him and his little brother, Prince Harry. Just hours after giving birth to their first child, Kate and William posed for photos outside of the hospital to give the public a glimpse at their newborn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kate-middleton-pregnant-1.jpeg><p>In September 2014, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced they were expecting another child. Unfortunately, just as Kate struggled with severe morning sickness during her first pregnancy, this time was no different. “We’re immensely thrilled, it’s great news, early days but I’m hoping that things settle down [and] she feels a bit better,” Prince William told reporters at the start of Kate’s second pregnancy, per <a rel=nofollow href=#>CNBC</a>. After being treated by doctors at home at Kensington Palace throughout her pregnancy, Kate went on to welcome a baby girl named Charlotte Elizabeth Diana on May 2, 2015. Just like her older brother George, William and Kate’s second child was introduced to the world outside of St. Mary’s hospital.</p><p>Charlotte’s name is an homage to her royal family members. Her first name is the feminine version of her grandfather Prince Charles’ name. Meanwhile, her middle names pay tribute to her late grandmother, Princess Diana, and her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. Before her great-granddaughter was born, Queen Elizabeth introduced the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, which now allowed&nbsp;both sons and daughters of any future monarch to have an equal right to the throne (previously, only male heirs had a right to succession.) This means Charlotte—whose official title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge—is officially third in the line of succession to the British throne after her older brother, George, and her father, Prince William.</p><p>“It’s very special having a new little girl. I feel very, very lucky that George has got a little sister,” Kate shared <a href=# rel=nofollow>at the time</a>. “The Queen was really thrilled that it was a little girl, and I think as soon as we came back here to Kensington she was one of our first visitors here.”</p><p>Just over two years after the birth of their daughter, William and Kate announced they were expecting their third child. The couple welcomed their son, Louis Arthur Charles, on April 23, 2018. Like his older siblings, his name has a sentimental meaning to the family. It has been speculated that he was named after his great-grandfather Prince Philip’s own grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, along with Prince Charles’ great-uncle and mentor, Earl Louis Mountbatten.</p><p>Officially speaking, Louis is known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge and holds the fourth position in the line of succession to the British throne behind his older siblings and his father, Prince William. Despite being the youngest of the bunch, Louis has arguably sparked the most attention out of his siblings thanks to his “cheeky” personality, having made headlines for his silly faces and antics at royal events throughout the years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kate-middleton-pregnant-photos>Kate Middleton Pregnant Photos</h2><p>Now that we know who’s who in the Cambridge brood, it’s time to take a look at Kate Middleton’s pregnancy photos to see Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis back when they were still inside their mother’s tummy.
