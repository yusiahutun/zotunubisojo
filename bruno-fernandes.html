He was born and raised in Maia, Porto.&nbsp;</p><p>The Midfielder was born to <strong>Jose Fernandez</strong> and <strong>Virginia Borges</strong>. Fernandes’s father was also a soccer player, and he used to wear the number 8 jersey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BRUNO.JPG.jpg><p>So, Bruno imprinted tattoos on both his arms with the number 8 as a tribute to his Father. Coincidentally, Bruno’s birth date is also on the 8th.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the Milkman developed a keen interest in soccer under the influence of his cousin Victor Borges. Victor played for Porto’s second-division club named Boavista at that time.</p><p>As for some additional information, Fernandes is fluent in Spanish, Italian, and English besides his native language, Portuguese.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bruno Fernandes’ Absence From The Match Against Burnley&nbsp;</h2><p>The United team played without their star midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, in their face-off against Burnley at Old Trafford.&nbsp;</p><p>The Thursday night game at Old Trafford missed the Portuguese midfielder due to Fernandes’ one-match ban ahead of this game.&nbsp;</p><p>The player got his fifth yellow card in the Premier League on Monday against Newcastle.&nbsp;</p><p>He got a yellow card after arguing with Craig Pawson, the match referee, regarding a decision in the Monday game.&nbsp;</p><p>The fifth yellow card consequently meant that the midfielder would not play the next home game against Burnley.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the match ended with the Red Devils victory. They owned the game with three goals over Burnely’s one.&nbsp;</p><h3>ManU Without Fernandes</h3><p>After the appointment of <a href=# rel=noopener>Ralf Rangnick</a> as the new manager of Manchester United, the team has deployed a new formation on the field.</p><p>The Red Devils are now using their trademark 4-2-2-2 formation.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Gary Neville</a>, the famous English soccer coach, and pundit believes that Rangnick can leave out Bruno Fernandes for this formation.</p><p>Fernandes has scored 45 goals and made 34 assists in his 102 appearances for United. And he scored 14 goals in the 2021-2022 season for the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bruno-Fernandes-and-Ralf-Rangnick.jpg><p>However, he has not had decent outings for the United team when deployed as one of the two No. 10s in their trademark 4-2-2-2 formation.&nbsp;</p><h3>What’s next?</h3><p><a href=#>Gary Neville</a> stated that Rangnick has to find a solution to get the best of Bruno back. But later mentioned that leaving him out entirely would be the best solution at present.&nbsp;</p><p>While speaking to Sky Sports, Naville stated that, and we quote,&nbsp;</p><p>“The same back four, the same front two, the same midfield two. The two positions that I’ve been looking at are the wide two, the two that come in to play as two in behind.”</p><p>He further added,&nbsp;</p><p>“I think you’ve somehow got to get Bruno in. But I don’t know how you get him in in this 4-2-2-2, where you’re not going to get exposed away from home in those wide areas; where Newcastle’s full-backs go forward.”</p><p><strong>Read Our Article On <a href=# rel=noopener>Top 20 Richest Soccer Players in the World >></a></strong></p><h3>Move To Italy</h3><p>Fernandes idolized <a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Ronaldinho</a>, and Zinedine Zidane during his early days.</p><p>Most of his childhood was about playing soccer on the streets of Portugal alongside his older brother Ricardo. Ricardo, too, was a professional soccer player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fernandes’s father had emigrated to Switzerland. However, Fernandes refused to shift to Switzerland and his father due to the lack of competency in soccer in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p><p>The young player began his soccer career at Novara in Italy (Serie B). He soon moved to Udinese (Serie A) in 2013. And then, went to Sampdoria after three years.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, Sporting CP offered a deal with him, and was later named the club captain.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bruno-Miguel-Borges-Fernandes-1011x1024.jpg><p>Winning back-to-back Texas da Liga in 2018 and 2019, he was awarded the Primeira Liga Team of the Year. He is also Primeira Liga Player of the Year in both seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>He is also a former youth international (Portuguese) who represented Portugal under-19, under-20, under-21, and under-23.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Most of Bruno’s early life information is known about his playing career.

And later moved to local rivals Sampdoria in 2016.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bruno-Fernandes-in-Sporting-Lisbon-1024x1024.jpg><p>Fernandes later returned to Portugal to join Sporting Lisbon in 2017.
