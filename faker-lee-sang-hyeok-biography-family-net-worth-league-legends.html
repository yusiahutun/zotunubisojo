But longevity is rare in LoL – mid-twenties is considered teetering on the sell-by date – and players tend to retire soon after owing to slower reflexes and adaptability.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So imagine everyone’s amazement when the man who had already done it all, three times no less, entered his 10th year as a professional looking as good as ever.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee’s SK T1 team, which he now leads having spent his entire career with the Seoul-based giants, completed an unprecedented 18-0 perfect regular league season this month. Having won the regular “split”, they continued their run to capture their 12th national title in April.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This season, Lee also became the first player to reach 700 games and 2,500 kills in Korea’s top division, LCK (League of Legends Champions Korea). That is a decade on top of the world’s most competitive league.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here’s what you need to know about the man who became the face of a franchise that raked in US$1.75 billion in 2020..</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Following his passion</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee Sang-hyeok was born on May 7, 1996, in Seoul and was raised by his single-parent father and grandparents. Lee Kyung-joon, a carpenter, had a laissez faire attitude towards his two sons’ passions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They didn’t stop me – they just told me to do what I wanted,” Lee told Korea Now in an interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A studious pupil, Lee was an already avid gamer before being introduced to LoL in high school. It did not take long for him to make a name for himself as an amateurs, and for then-named SKT T1 K to come calling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a single parent, it’s my role to support my son,” Lee Kyung-joon told ESPN after his son dropped out of Mapo High School.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He’s doing this because he wants to. I thought … if I don’t let him do what the wants to do, there might be regret. Then I started thinking, ‘wow, he’s really good at this’.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Originally playing under the handle “GoJeonPa”, Lee was already showing his potential by 2013. The newly branded T1 team won their inaugural world title, before going unbeaten in the winter season of 2014.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having failed to qualify for worlds the following season, several Chinese clubs circled with lucrative playing and streaming contracts. It was the prelude to what is now referred to as the 2015 “Korean Exodus”. Lee ultimately declined the offers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Faker and his team lost just one game on their way to winning their second worlds that season, with his workload shared with Lee Ji-hoon, or “Easyhoon”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2016, a scintillating T1 lifted their first MSI – the only major trophy to evade them at the time – and won back-to-back worlds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite winning their second consecutive MSI, Faker was left in tears at the 2017 worlds after being neutralised by a legendary Samsung Galaxy in the final in Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve seen him have a few difficult matches, but it’s the first time I saw him cry,” his father told ESPN.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I can see why the prejudices around the ‘older players’ exist in this scene, because it has been the case until nowLee Sang-hyeok</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That the team had cemented themselves as one of the greatest in history was besides the point. Lee had crumbled under the pressure, missing out on a third world consecutive championship amid increased competition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Mind control is very important,” he said. “I usually judge myself and try to over come myself, so I make myself a role model and work hard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At first, it did feel like a burden [to be called the GOAT], but since I no longer care about how other people see me, I actually feel very proud to have that title.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though T1 bowed out of the 2019 worlds semi-finals, a reinvigorated Lee guided them to two more LCK titles and became the first to get 2,000 kills in the league. He was rewarded with a part-ownership of T1 Entertainment and Sports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He nonetheless re-signed with T1 last November, and is now part of a group that pundits have touted as the sport’s most mechanically gifted team to date.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Longer lifespans</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I can see why the prejudices around the ‘older players’ exist in this scene, because it has been the case until now,” Lee told Korizon Esports after the team’s 12th consecutive LCK win this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most players’ careers end in their mid- to late- 20s. But I am of the opinion that players currently active in the scene will enjoy longer lifespans. We will continue to see more examples to support this argument in the future.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Let’s be honest … This is my tenth year as a professional gamer. Most older players, even the players who have not played as long as I, have now retired. The veterans that are left are the ones who can adapt to new meta quickly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would say ‘survival of the fittest’ played a role here. But in the end, I’d say there is no drastic link between a player’s age and performance.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In fact, Lee had forecast as such four years earlier. “I want to keep on until I’m 27, or even older,” he told The Korean Herald in 2018. “And I’m confident that I can continue to do so.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a decade in the game, nobody – not even the dozens of players touted as “the next Fakers” – has even come close.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/02/2c139094-8977-4180-923b-0463b85e4cfd_a66cec46.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Champion Ocean</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While most elite-level players specialise in a few dozen of the 159 game characters, or “champions”, Lee has a mastery of them all.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an LCK game in March, Lee broke his own record for most unique picks by a mid-laner with 72. His champions pool is so large that fans refer to it as an “ocean”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee’s adaptability to the continuous updates and patches by the Riot Games developers, and his opponents’ strategic use of the rule allowing each team to ban five opposing champions in the pregame selection, is considered one of his greatest strengths.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My strength is understanding the flow of the game, when to fight and when not to fight. Regardless of which champion I play, the strength is there,” Lee told ESPN.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Combine with his flawless technical abilities and game knowledge, and you have the Unkillable Demon King. Put him in a team of younger and hungrier players including this season’s LCK MVP, Ryu Min-seok aka “Keria”, and the their opponents have a problem on their hands.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Asian Games experiment</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The only one major piece of silverware that evades Lee is an official national team title. And that is only because it will not exist until September.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/02/56d5af16-3295-4c1a-a1f1-8d2463d65ece_7d4b56d9.jpg>While it is unclear how much weight the community gives to such events, it could be a gateway to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">its inclusion at a future Olympics</span></a>. Another medal that Lee would surely welcome to his cabinet.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To add to the intrigue, there is a high potential of a Korea v China showdown – not at franchise level, but directly under their national flags.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s big esports win boosts distressed gaming industry</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At the Asian Games, I felt a more diverse demographic of viewers were watching us. We definitely felt more pressure going into the matches,” Lee said after Jakarta.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But from all the new-found attention, I felt that more and more people were coming to accept and be interested in esports.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Net worth</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Faker” is as mainstream as it gets. He tops a game played by 180 million monthly active users, with the 2019 worlds finals netting more than 100 million unique viewers – beating the NFL Super Bowl in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee’s first Twitch live stream peaked at 245,100 – concurrent, not overall views – setting a world record at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has amassed more than US$1.3 million in prize money alone, with the official Olympics page putting his salary at “just shy of US$5 million per year” in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee’s popularity back home is only magnified. He has starred in adverts with footballing icon Son Heung-min, and has been compared to international K-pop sensations BTS in terms of cultural influence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is a documentary comparing Lee’s career with that of Brazilian football legend Ronaldo. “O Fenomeno” even put the winner’s medal around Lee’s neck at the 2017 MSIs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every time I get compared to Sonny and BTS I feel grateful.
