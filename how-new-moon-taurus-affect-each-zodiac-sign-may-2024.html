Luckily, this fixed earth sign can steady whatever course of action you may want to focus on. You can create a luxurious life if you invoke the tenacity and determination of Taurus during this lunar cycle.</p><p>Typically, Taurus season is rather easygoing. The leisurely pace is something we can all look forward to since no other zodiacal season is this calm or comforting. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taurus season 2024</a> is unlike any other. Just a few weeks earlier, Jupiter in Taurus joined Uranus in Taurus on April 20 for the first time in fourteen years.</p><p>When Jupiter and Uranus collide, an unexpected twist in luck may occur. Jupiter typically represents <a href=#>growth,</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> abundance, and expansion</a> whereas Uranus denotes change, unpredictability, and plot twists. When these two work together, there might be larger-than-life twists and turns. Since both planets are in Taurus, you may notice extreme differences in your financial state, material items, and value systems. You may find that you desire radically different things in your life as this rare transit unfolds. Where could your journey lead?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-3.png><p>New pathways will emerge with the new moon in Taurus on May 7, 2024, at 11:21 p.m. ET, which will occur 18 degrees. New moons represent a new chapter in your life. The following six months could be an exceptionally productive period as your manifestations come to fruition. So, the new moon in Taurus will be an excellent time to set your intentions! Plus, this new moon is special. It’s the first new moon in Taurus that hasn’t doubled as an eclipse in the last year. And the moon is exalted in Taurus, so it’s an especially strong lunation.</p><p>A feeling of stability will settle in during the lunation. You might feel more secure with what you value and desire. Your steadiness can help you lay the groundwork <a href=#>for the lunar c</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ycle</a>. Given that this lunation is occurring in an earth sign, you should do something tangible to kick off your manifestations. Luna will also answer to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Venus—the planetary ruler of Taurus</a>—so you could create something to represent what you want to manifest. Art, music, or another form of craftsmanship could help you set your intentions in stone.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-25.png><p>As expected, the new moon will be in perfect alignment with the sun in Taurus. The sun-moon alignment is also part of a greater Taurus stellium, which <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>includes Venus</a>, Jupiter, and Uranus. Since the Taurus stellium will be immensely strong, you will be called to consider the physical means in your world. The Taurus stellium will encourage you to pursue whatever aligns with your need for comfort. Items like clothes, or services that enhance your self-care may become more important to you during this time. It’s not to say that you’ll become materialistic or greedy. But it’s to say that your personal belongings and expenses are important for your overall quality of life. Move with grace, humility, and tenacity throughout the six-month lunar cycle as you build a luxurious life.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The new moon in Taurus takes place on May 7 at 11:21 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Aside from the Taurus stellium, the new moon in Taurus will also harmonize with Saturn in Pisces. Taskmaster Saturn will encourage you to be responsible for fulfilling your lunar manifestations and intentions. The following six months could be incredibly productive if you put in the work. You may feel like your wildest dreams are plausible. As long as you are realistic, consistent, and hopeful, you can accomplish anything you desire during this lunar cycle.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-new-moon-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How the New Moon Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming new moon in Taurus, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a>, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8729198184569><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_aries.png><p>What kind of material or financial goal do you want to work toward, Aries? The new moon in Taurus will begin a new cycle in your second house of personal belongings, values, and financial security. You may feel more steady and stable as you consider the six-month lunar journey. Luna could help you manifest something physical into your life, like acquiring a particular item you’ve desired.

Over the next six months, you may experiment more with your style and self-care. It could be a fantastic time to rejuvenate your routine.

Your mental health may be your top concern when the new moon activates your twelfth house of the subconscious and spirit realm. Your mind often races, so the exalted lunation will encourage you to slow down. It might be time to pace yourself to the best of your ability.
