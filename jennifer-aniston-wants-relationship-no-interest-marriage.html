"I'd love a relationship. Who knows? There are moments I want to just crawl up in a ball and say, 'I need support.' It would be wonderful to come home and fall into somebody's arms and say, 'That was a tough day.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aniston was famously <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36826854/jennifer-aniston-buddies-with-brad-pitt/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="married to Brad Pitt" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">married to Brad Pitt</a> from 2000 to 2005. During that time, they were the stylish, beautiful, so in love It couple of Hollywood, and so their sudden split came as a big surprise. Shortly after announcing their separation, Pitt very publicly moved on with Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar Angelina Jolie, with whom he soon welcomed three kids and adopted three more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the years following her divorce from Pitt, Aniston dated actor Vince Vaughn and singer John Mayer before falling for Justin Theroux, who would become her second husband. The two married in 2015 and divorced in 2018. Sources at the time said the marriage didn't work because Aniston wanted to continue her life in Los Angeles, while Theroux liked spending more time in New York City. Regardless, the two <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29561535/jennifer-aniston-texted-justin-theroux-instagram-follow/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="remain friends" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">remain friends</a> today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also in her talk with Allure, Aniston revealed that a few years ago—potentially during her marriage to Theroux—she underwent IVF and was "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a41910828/jennifer-aniston-reveals-ivf-tried-get-pregnant-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="trying to get pregnant" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">trying to get pregnant</a>." Unfortunately, it didn't work out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road," she told the magazine. "All the years and years and years of speculation ... it was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The speculations about her and the "narrative that I was just selfish" for not having kids, Aniston said, are what hurt the most. "I just cared about my career. And God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child. And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies. I don't have anything to hide at this point," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, she said she has "zero regrets" and is glad she can now put the idea of becoming a parent out of her mind for good. "I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.' I don't have to think about that anymore," she said, adding that she feels better today, at 53, than she ever did in her 20s, 30s, or 40s.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
