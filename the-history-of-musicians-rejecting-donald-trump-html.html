Throughout Trump’s journey of rallies, campaign stops, <a href=#>alleged Juneteenth events</a>, and more, numerous musicians have publicly demanded Trump disassociate himself with their work, a movement that has arguably been best pioneered by the president’s favorite artist, Neil Young. (Yeah, <a href=#>that’s got to hurt</a>.) Take a stroll down memory lane and see just how long the history, which we sorted chronologically, has become.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5pdddg00353c60meox81kk@published>Pissed-off victim No. 1: Neil Young</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5pcxf8002m3c60ugu85knx@published data-word-count=138>The first rocker to throw some cantankerous shade Trump’s way was none other than Young in June 2015, who found himself embroiled in a spat with Trump regarding the use of “Rockin’ in the Free World,” which was used as background noise for his official presidential campaign announcement at Trump Tower. “Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America,” Young’s label <a href=#>asserted</a> about this “not authorized” faux pas, to which Trump’s campaign team responded with … literal receipts. “Mr. Trump’s campaign paid for and obtained the legal right to use Neil Young’s recording of ‘Rockin’ in the Free World’ at today’s event,” a spokesperson said. “Mr. Trump is a huge fan of Neil Young and his music and will continue to be regardless of Neil’s political views.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5pcxeh002i3c60xjql0pos@published data-word-count=91>Interestingly, the future president almost immediately ceased playing “Rockin’ in the Free World,” even with the legal logistics in his favor — owing to Trump’s lifelong affection for Young. “Mr. Trump is a big fan and likes Neil very much,” campaign manager Corey Lewandowski <a href=#>said</a> at the time. “We will respect his wish.” Unwilling to not have the last word, though, Young <a href=#>proceeded to stress</a> how Trump’s “misogyny” and “racism” were not rockin’ him politically, and that he’d happily give Bernie Sanders any of his music, should he ever request it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdqfi5s3001o3h676o0ziq16@published data-word-count=99>Then, Young resurfaced the “Rockin’ in the Free World” issue with a <a href=#>strongly worded statement</a> in November 2018 (which occurred during Trump’s midterms rallies), saying that while he has no legal grounds to block Trump from doing so, misusing the song violates his personal and political values. “He chose not to listen to my request,” Young wrote in an open letter, “just as he chooses not to listen to the many American voices who ask him to stop his constant lies, to stop his petty, nasty name calling and bullying, to stop pushing his dangerous, vilifying and hateful rhetoric.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdqfp62w00223h67nbtm61uk@published data-word-count=121>Upon becoming an American citizen in early 2020, Young has escalated his hatred toward Trump, <a href=#>stating</a> that the president is a “disgrace to my country” who shouldn’t “trot out” his songs whenever he feels like it. After criticizing Trump’s COVID-19 response and <a href=#>threatening a lawsuit</a> against him in July, Young officially filed a copyright infringement case in August, which stems from the Trump campaign using “Rockin’ in the Free World” and “Devil’s Sidewalk” on several occasions during 2020 political rallies and stops. <a href=#>The lawsuit states</a> that the campaign “does not now have, and did not have” a license or Young’s permission to play the two songs, and is thus seeking “statutory damages in the maximum amount allowed for willful copyright infringement.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5pdmug003f3c60blbv0hob@published>Pissed-off victim No. 2: R.E.M.</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5pcxeq002l3c60h3f72tlf@published data-word-count=153>You could say Michael Stipe was totally not feeling fine about Trump’s frequent use of “It’s the End of the World” as a pump-up jam at his 2015 campaign rallies, so much so that the entire band crafted a cease and desist letter to make the madness stop. “The media and the American voter should focus on the bigger picture, and not allow grandstanding politicians to distract us from the pressing issues of the day and of the current presidential campaign,” R.E.M. <a href=#>wrote in a statement</a> that confirmed their legal action, which is nice and all, but Stipe’s Twitter musings had a bit more chutzpah, addressing the Republican institution as a whole: “Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you — you sad, attention grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.” The band later <a href=#>released</a> an anti-Trump song titled “World Leader Pretend.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5pdwup003p3c60d0opqj7g@published>Pissed-off victim No. 3: Twisted Sister</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5pcxed002h3c60pix52i78@published data-word-count=95>Twisted Sister front man Dee Snider originally allowed Trump to use the band’s iconic jam “We’re Not Gonna Take It” as his closing song on the campaign trail in 2015, owing to the two being friends. (Snider had a stint on Celebrity Apprentice a few years prior.) At the time, Snider <a href=#>believed Trump was</a> going to “raise holy hell” by “shaking things up” in the American political system, even saying Trump had a great sense of self-deprecating humor because he frequently joked about “being too orange.” A few months later, though, the honeymoon period ended.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5pnc7q001g3c60m9htmox7@published data-word-count=152>Realizing the full extent of Trump’s political ideology, Snider ended up giving him a call to say, well, he’s not gonna take it anymore. “It’s very upsetting to me, ’cause I strongly don’t agree with his extremist positions,” <a href=#>Snider explained</a> in late 2015. “I have to call Donald. I have to speak to him, as a friend. He was respectful enough to call me and say, ‘How do you feel about me using this?’ And I’ve gotta be — as a friend — respectful enough to call him and say, ‘Listen, man, this has gotten wildly out of control, and I really have a problem with it.’ It’s really gotten ugly.” Fellow band member Jay Jay French <a href=#>also voiced</a> his annoyance at the song being used, explaining how the band, despite their “personal political leanings always [being] all over the map,” couldn’t in good faith allow Trump to keep using the song.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5ue5o2001g2c61rbhasoqd@published>Pissed-off victim No. 4: Adele</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5uec9w001m2c61dwf9ycxx@published data-word-count=115>Deviating from his jukebox classic-rock standards, Trump showed a particular fondness for Adele throughout the 2015 and 2016 campaign by employing a medley of the songstress’s hits, including “Rolling in the Deep” and “Skyfall,” the theme she crooned for the James Bond film. “Adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning,” her spokesperson <a href=#>said</a> in February 2016. To solidify her point, Adele later <a href=#>went on to endorse</a> Hillary Clinton for president in front of tens of thousands of American concert attendees: “Don’t vote for him. I am English, but what happens in America affects me, too. I am 100 percent for Hillary Clinton. I love her, she’s amazing.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5ugmvn001s2c619adpd15g@published>Pissed-off victim No. 5: Elton John</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5uguq5001y2c61ms02ex6e@published data-word-count=144>It’s <a href=#>well-documented</a> that Trump is fascinated with Elton John, a feeling that, <a href=#>as most recently detailed</a> in John Bolton’s memoir, isn’t reciprocated. In February 2016, John <a href=#>publicly denounced</a> his songs being used in the Trumpian orbit, which came to light when Trump would frequently use “Rocket Man” and “Tiny Dancer” as warm-up music for his campaign rallies — although John noted they had nothing but pleasant interactions in the past. “I’m British. I’ve met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it’s nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I’m not a Republican in a million years,” John said, before laying down an exquisite burn. “Why not ask Ted fucking Nugent? Or one of those fucking country stars? They’ll do it for you.” John would later go on <a href=#>to quickly deny</a> Trump’s request to perform at his inauguration.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5v07vh00242c61kk2785g8@published>Pissed-off victim No. 6: The Rolling Stones</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5v0swy002a2c614stah3u9@published data-word-count=143>Satisfaction for the Rolling Stones was unattainable after Trump began to frequently lean on the band’s tunes to pump up the crowds at his campaign rallies in 2015 and 2016 — “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” was, oddly, a favorite — <a href=#>which culminated</a> with Trump blasting “Start Me Up” during his celebration speech upon clinching the Republican presidential nomination. The Stones had to release statements not once, but twice, in 2016 <a href=#>demanding</a> that Trump immediately “cease all use” of their songs, clarifying that they “do not endorse” the nominee, after he kept using their songs “without the band’s permission.” Mick Jagger eventually <a href=#>conceded</a> that there was no effective way to get Trump to stop using their music, equating the usage to something a theater or restaurant does as background noise: “They can play what they want … you can’t stop them.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdqg8g4100273h671abeyjwm@published data-word-count=119>However, in June 2020, the Stones <a href=#>reversed course</a> and threatened to pursue legal action against Trump for his continued use of their music at political rallies in the lead-up to the election. The band’s legal team at BMI, the prominent music rights organization, have issued numerous cease and desist letters to Trump’s campaign. “This could be the last time President Donald Trump uses Stones songs,” a statement&nbsp;read. “BMI have notified the Trump campaign on behalf of the Stones that the unauthorized use of their songs will constitute a breach of its licensing agreement. If Donald Trump disregards the exclusion and persists, then he would face a lawsuit for breaking the embargo and playing music that has not been licensed.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5vq7ar002g2c618f8whuc2@published>Pissed-off victim No. 7: Queen</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5vrnwg002w2c6138w7u9k7@published data-word-count=149>In June 2016, Queen condemned the repeated usage of their beloved jam “We Are the Champions” during Trump’s stage appearance at the Republican National Convention. “I can confirm that permission to use the track was neither sought nor given,” Brian May, one of the band’s three surviving members, <a href=#>explained</a>. “Regardless of our views on Mr. Trump’s platform, it has always been against our policy to allow Queen music to be used as a political campaigning tool.” The whole band <a href=#>later reiterated</a> that the “unauthorized use” of the song might spur legal action on their part, should they be so inclined, as Trump continued to use “We Are the Champions” in the months leading up to the 2016 election. “We are frustrated by the repeated unauthorized use of the song after a previous request to desist,” they collectively said, “which has obviously been ignored by Mr. Trump and his campaign.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5wavsx00322c61k74lch8v@published>Pissed-off victim No. 8: George Harrison’s estate</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5wb4u400382c61okfz7vwf@published data-word-count=84>The 2016 Republican National Convention seemed to be the ground zero of musicians being pissed off at Trump, as the estate of George Harrison immediately denounced the <a href=#>“unauthorized” use </a>of the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun” — which was written by Harrison for Abbey Road — as walk-on music for both Trump and his daughter Ivanka. “It’s offensive and against the wishes of the George Harrison estate,” Harrison’s official Twitter wrote. “If it had been ‘Beware of Darkness,’ then we may have approved it!”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5wm1l5003e2c61wz4ev9ff@published>Pissed-off victim No. 9: Luciano Pavarotti’s estate</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5wm8uj003k2c61h38hhz8q@published data-word-count=125>In a similar scenario, the estate of prolific opera singer Luciano Pavarotti was quick to defend the late tenor’s honor when Trump heavily featured his aria “Nessun Dorma” as a soundtrack to many of his rallies in 2016. The singer’s widow, Nicoletta Mantovani Pavarotti, along with his immediate family, <a href=#>proclaimed that</a> the “values of brotherhood and solidarity” Pavarotti expressed “throughout the course of his artistic career are entirely incompatible with the world view” embodied by Trump. Interestingly, about a year and a half after becoming president, <a href=#>Trump asserted</a> during a press conference with Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni that Pavarotti, who died in 2007 of pancreatic cancer, was a “great friend” of his. It seems the duo, perhaps at best, shared <a href=#>a complicated</a> boss-underling relationship.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjl5wmf3q003q2c617gpbc8rs@published>Pissed-off victim No. 10: Steven Tyler</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5xnnl4003x2c61p8xj8tpr@published data-word-count=119>Twice in 2015, Steven Tyler’s reps<a href=#> presented Trump</a> with a cease and desist letter for his frequent use of “Dream On” at rallies and campaign stops, a song that often prompted Trump to try to air-drum during the instrumentals. (We really encourage you to watch <a href=#>this video</a>.) Following a few months of back-and-forth, Trump <a href=#>relented</a> and stopped using the power ballad, confirming his decision in one of his signature Twitter musings: “Even though I have the legal right to use Steven Tyler’s song, he asked me not to. Have better one to take its place!” We should note that fellow Aerosmith members Joe Perry and Joey Kramer are vocal Republicans, with Kramer, <a href=#>in particular</a>, being a major Trump supporter.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjl5ymlv000432c614b8opjlr@published data-word-count=110>History repeated itself in April 2018, when another cease and desist letter was dusted off by Tyler and mailed to Trump, as the president enjoyed using “Livin’ on the Edge” throughout his midterm rallies. “What makes this violation even more egregious is that Mr. Trump’s use of our client’s music was previously shut down, not once, but two times, during his campaign for presidency in 2015,” the letter from his attorney <a href=#>read</a>, in part. “Mr. Tyler’s voice is easily recognizable and central to his identity, and any use thereof wrongfully misappropriates his rights of publicity.” Tyler’s attorney also asserted that the original cease and desist letters were ignored by Trump.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnvrcwmd000x2c64gop4xilh@published>Pissed-off Victim No. 11: Prince’s estate</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnvrda5000122c64bhoci2n7@published data-word-count=80>Following suits with the estates of Harrison and Pavarotti, <a href=#>Prince’s estate issued a statement </a>in October 2018, warning both Trump and the White House to never to use “Purple Rain” again after the president played it at one of his midterm election rallies. “The Prince Estate has never given permission to President Trump or The White House to use Prince’s songs and have requested that they cease all use immediately,” Prince’s half-brother and of one his heirs, Omarr Baker, wrote.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnvr2i78000n2c64nghuyohk@published>Pissed-off Victim No. 12: Pharrell Williams</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnvr307t000s2c64358w1rt7@published data-word-count=170>In October 2018, Trump played Williams’s feel-good jam “Happy” at his Future Farmers of America rally in Indiana just hours after <a href=#>11 people were murdered at a Pittsburgh synagogue</a> in an anti-Semitic mass shooting. Williams responded by having his lawyer send Trump an <a href=#>impassioned cease and desist letter</a> ordering the president to stop playing “Happy” at political rallies and shaming him for playing it after a tremendous hate crime was committed. “On the day of the mass murder of 11 human beings at the hands of a deranged ‘nationalist,’ you played his song ‘Happy’ to a crowd at a political event in Indiana,” a statement read. “There was nothing ‘happy’ about the tragedy inflicted upon our country on Saturday and no permission was granted for your use of this song for this purpose.

Maybe Kayne West (‘Gold Digger’), Kid Rock (‘I Am the Bullgod’) or Ted Nugent (‘Stranglehold’) will allow use of their music.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckdqh41aq002m3h6706p7d5ey@published>Pissed-off Victim No. 16: Tom Petty’s estate</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdqh6se0002r3h67vjztjd98@published data-word-count=100>As the first high-profile music dispute against Trump in 2020, Petty’s estate issued a cease and desist to his campaign for using “I Won’t Back Down” at a June <a href=#>rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>. “Tom wrote this song for the underdog, for the common man and for everyone,” Petty’s family members stated. “We want to make it clear that we believe everyone is free to vote as they like, think as they like, but the Petty family doesn’t stand for this.

The song was still used at the RNC despite the lack of clearance, and the estate is now “exploring our legal options” on how to proceed. (A cover of the song, by Tori Kelly, was played after Trump’s acceptance speech.) “We are surprised and dismayed that the RNC would proceed knowing that the Cohen Estate had specifically declined the RNC’s use request,” a statement read, “and their rather brazen attempt to politicize and exploit in such an egregious manner ‘Hallelujah,’ one of the most important songs in the Cohen song catalogue.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckelgvq36000e3h7bd223u3q4@published>Pissed-off Victim No. 19: Eddy Grant</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckelgw82b000n3h7b928x4j9q@published data-word-count=77>Eddy Grant, the British singer-songwriter whose hit “Electric Avenue” became a smash in the 1980s, was able to successfully get the song removed from a Trump campaign video on Twitter.<strong> </strong>On September 1, 2020, Twitter <a href=#>confirmed</a> that it received a copyright complaint from Grant, and, per company policy, the president’s video was removed.<strong> </strong>Grant has <a href=#>also</a> filed a lawsuit against Trump’s campaign, arguing that it has “continued to willfully and wrongfully infringe copyrights” with its “wrongful conduct.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckggqhzzr000f3g69eondnri8@published>Pissed-off Victim No. 20: Phil Collins</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckggqi777000k3g69st364gf3@published data-word-count=94>After Trump played the greatest drum-break song of all time, “In the Air Tonight,” at a rally in Iowa on October 14, 2020, Phil Collins’s legal team issued a cease-and-desist order to the president.

I also wrote about wealthy people not paying their fair share of taxes. Mr. Trump is a prime example of both of these issues. The fact that Mr. Trump also fans the flames of hatred, racism, and fear while rewriting recent history, is even more reason to be troubled by his use of my song.”</p><h2>More From The Politics Beat...</h2><ul class=package-list-items><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clqv4r7u900000pl3sr6eoyj5@published data-track-headline="Green Day Shaded Trump (Again) on New Year’s Eve" data-track-index=0 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Green Day Shaded Trump (Again) on New Year’s Eve</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clpkgt2j000140ifvqzv2atz7@published data-track-headline="Sebastian Stan to Play Young Donald Trump in Ali Abbasi’s The Apprentice" data-track-index=1 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Sebastian Stan to Play Young Donald Trump in Ali Abbasi’s The Apprentice</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clmi20cu400140ifztmur8pxr@published data-track-headline="Donald Trump Will Be the First Big Guest on the New Meet the Press" data-track-index=2 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Donald Trump Will Be the First Big Guest on the New Meet the Press</span></a></li></ul><a class=see-all-link href=# aria-label="See All from More From The Politics Beat..."><span class=see-all-link-text>See All</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The History of Musicians Rejecting Donald Trump</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny1tMRmn6KrpKS%2FunnOn2SmraOesKqtzaxkq52amrC1tc2gZJ2nnpa5pXnTq6ymqF6dwa64</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tyra-banks-nose-job-plastic-surgery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tyra Banks Admits Nose Job Plastic Surgery Interview">&larr;
