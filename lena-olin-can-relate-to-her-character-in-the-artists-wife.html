The Stockholm-born actress, who won an Oscar for portraying a Holocaust survivor in 1989’s Enemies, A Love Story, has brilliantly portrayed women of many nationalities and walks of life during her illustrious four-decade career.</p><p>“My English changes with whatever character I’m playing,” Lena, who currently stars in the Amazon Prime series Hunters, exclusively tells Closer. On that show, “I have a British, slightly German accent. It’s like I don’t ever have my own accent in English!” she says.</p><p>The actress, 65, who lives in New York with her husband and frequent collaborator, director <strong>Lasse Hallström</strong>, will next star in the drama The Artist’s Wife, which is scheduled for release on September 25.</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling below for Closer‘s exclusive Q&A interview with Lena Olin.</strong></p><h2>Growing up in Sweden, you were raised in a theatrical family. Would your parents have been crushed if you grew up to be an accountant?</h2><p>[Laughs] My dad was a writer/director/ actor and my mom was an actress. That’s what I was surrounded with when I grew up. Actors, directors, writers. I knew no normal people.</p><h2>So it felt natural for you to enter the family business?</h2><p>My parents only had one wish for me and that was just to be happy. It’s a really tough wish to fulfill! I was the youngest and a girl. I was very hardworking in school. I thought maybe I could become a doctor, but that wasn’t really truthful [to my calling]. I was very shy growing up but found a huge freedom onstage through acting and being able to express myself that way.</p><h2>You were crowned Miss Scandinavia in 1974. Did you enjoy your pageant days?</h2><p>It was not fun. Eileen Ford was a big modeling agent in New York. She came to Sweden and offered to take me back to New York as a model. She said I should get into modeling in Sweden and have beauty titles first. She was very confident in me [but] I didn’t go to New York. I was too angst-ridden and too afraid to do it. At that point in my life, [modeling] wasn’t my thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lena-olin-1987.jpg><h2>The famed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman wrote a role for you in one of his films when you were just 21.</h2><p>In those days in Sweden, to be picked by Bergman and get his blessing and his interest, that gave me a huge amount of confidence. It was really such a treat to work with him. He taught me a lot. I learned that although you might be talented, it’s all about the work you put in — how you have to learn the craft and really apply yourself. I think that was a huge.</p><h2>In 1988, The Unbearable Lightness of Being with Daniel Day-Lewis was your first big international hit.</h2><p>I actually saw Daniel [before COVID-19] — we’re neighbors in the city. We talked about that shoot and how much comfort we drew from each other. I was fragile and had just gone through a breakup and Daniel, he had a lot of things going on, too. I love him and his work. He is just an amazing person.</p><h2>Your role as Jennifer Garner’s mysterious mother on the first season of television’s Alias introduced you to a whole other audience.</h2><p>It’s so fun that people are still talking about Alias and loved it. That was my first TV role. I met with Jen and there was something so true about our relationship. We had a very natural way with each other. We seemed related. And of course, Victor [Garber]. Some acting families you just love a little bit more, and that was certainly one of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lena-olin-husband-1993.jpg><h2>Your latest TV project is Amazon Prime’s Hunters, which is scheduled to come back for a second season. How has it been working with Al Pacino on the show?</h2><p>Al is a cool, cool guy. He doesn’t take anything for granted. His way of working is so curious because he wants to understand why he’s doing everything he is doing on-screen. He doesn’t just come in and do his line because he’s Al Pacino. He jokes about that. He makes such an effort and is a sweet and generous guy.</p><h2>You’ve been married to director Lasse Hallström since 1994 and you’ve done several films together. Is it hard to work with your spouse?</h2><p>We have a really fun, extremely creative collaboration, which has been such a joy. On set, I feel we have a shorthand. And when we work in America, he can speak to me in Swedish and no one quite understands what we’re talking about. [Laughs] I find it very romantic to shoot with him. He’s such a splendid director. It’s romantic and inspiring.</p><h2>What is the greatest lesson you’ve learned about love?</h2><p>In a true love, you dare to be who you truly are and you find out through love who you really are. I think that you need to be very honest and take to heart the deeper understanding of who you really are. You have to be very true to yourself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lena-olin-2018.jpg><h2>In your latest movie, The Artist’s Wife, you play a woman who puts aside her own artistic ambitions for her husband, another painter, played by Bruce Dern.</h2><p>It is such a layered character. I don’t really want to call [what she does] a sacrifice, because I feel like she went where her heart told her to go. I don’t see her as a victim. I see her as a strong survivor. These are choices we make. She does it out of love. I think it’s an interesting concept of what we do for love.</p><h2>Could you relate to your character Claire on a personal level?</h2><p>Yes, I think I have done things without even thinking there is an option out of love for [Lasse]. Or the things you do out of love for your children. So on some level, I can relate to her.</p><h2>Was it difficult to balance your acting career with being a mother of two?</h2><p>I think I am really a hands-on mother, but it has been good for my children that I’ve been away working for periods of time. They were exposed to other people, and that has been a blessing for them. When they have partners, boyfriends, girlfriends, when they [meet new people] they so easily love them and become loved themselves. I think that is probably because of their upbringing.</p><p>— Reporting by Amanda Champagne-Meadows</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46lnKeZXaS5qrqMnJinZaKauaLAxGarqGWYmr9ur8eaqZqbpJq%2FbrXNZquhnV2Wv7W10q2qZq%2BZm7Jw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./article-f4b76a70-441c-11e9-a77f-cbc340803a9a-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big day for Bay | Sports">&larr;
