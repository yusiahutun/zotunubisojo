You may be surprised by what happened after filming ended.</p><p>The Perfect Match is a <a href=# id=auto-tag_netflix data-tag=netflix>Netflix</a> reality <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a> dating show hosted by Nick Lachey (who also hosts <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> and The Ultimatum). The series sees former contestants from Netflix reality TV shows—including Love Is Blind, Too Hot to Handle, The Circle, The Ultimatum and The Mole—move into a villa in a tropical location, where they date each other in the hopes of finding their perfect match. Each week, contestants who don’t have a match are eliminated as new contestants arrive at the villa to try to break up couples and find a match of their own. In the end, the couple voted by the eliminated contestants as the perfect match are named the winners and receive a cash prize.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>“It’s a show full of love and drama and conflict and strategy and gameplay,” The Perfect Match executive producer Chris Coelen told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in February 2023. “Different people come in with different motivations; different people come in with different emotional baggage. There’s certainly no stated intent in this show that there is a specific goal. It’s very reflective of where they are in their lives, and they might just be looking for somebody to spend the summer with, or have a fling with — or maybe they are looking for someone who’s a life partner. It’s really up to them to figure out what their own perfect match is.”</p><p>He continued, “Obviously, Valentine’s Day is a holiday that’s rife with symbolism about love. We’re all into the new year, and we’re thinking about our lives and our partners, or lack of partners. These shows are incredibly enjoyable at any time of the year, but I love that we get to see a show like Perfect Match come out on Valentine’s Day.”</p><p>So <a href=# rel=noopener>who’s still together from The Perfect Match</a> season 1 and where are Francesca and Damian; Dom and Georgia; Joey and Kariselle; Chloe and Shayne; Bartise and Izzy; and Nick and LC now? Read on for what we know about who’s still together from The Perfect Match season 1 and what happened to each of the final couples.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Perfect-Match.jpg><p>Who’s still together from The Perfect Match?&nbsp; Read on for who’s still together from The Perfect Match season 1 and where the 2023 couples are now.</p><h2>Are Francesca and Damian still together from The Perfect Match season 1?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Francesca-Damian-Perfect-Match.jpg><p>Relationship status: Broken up</p><p>Are <a href=# rel=noopener>Francesca and Damian still together from The Perfect Match</a> season 1? The answer is no. Francesca and Damian broke up in episode 11 of The Perfect Match after Francesca told Damian that she didn’t think their relationship would work off camera. “I didn’t want to leave this house with anyone I wasn’t 100 percent certain on because leaving here in a relationship is so risky to me and I don’t want to do it unless I’m 100 percent certain. But I don’t know if we would work outside of this house,” Francesca told Damian. Damian told Francesca, “I already wanted to commit to you outside of this,” to which Francesca responded, “But why? What do you even like about me? I know you like that I’m attractive, but we were so bad in that compatibility challenge. We don’t sit down and have in-depth conversations about anything. I don’t know if you know me deep down and I don’t know if I know you deep down.” She continued, “I’m just unsure I can move forward.”</p><p>Before her relationship with Damian, Francesca was matched with Dom Gabriel, a contestant from The Mole season 1, and Abbey Humphreys, a cast member from Twentysomethings: Austin season 1. In a confessional after she left The Perfect Match, Francesca joked that she was going to “go home and text” her ex. “I had a great thing with Dom, and I had an amazing few days with Abbey, and me and Damian, I’m glad I explored that,” she said. “I wanna say I’m not going to go home and text my ex, but…I probably should do that. I’ve learned a lot. I’ve grown. Just gonna go home and cuddle my dog.” As of writing this, Francesca and Damian still ollow each other on Instagram. Damian also follows Francesca’s Instagram promoting her Only Fans account, @<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">francescafarago2.0</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> in March 2023, Francesca confirmed that she’s in a relationship with her ex, TikTok star Jesse Sullivan. “I ended up getting home and messaging someone I had already known,” she said. “We connected right away, and we’ve been really happy together ever since. I’m in a super solid place in my relationship right now.”</p><p>Who is Francesca from The Perfect Match season 1? Francesca Farago is a 30-year-old from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She was originally a contestant on Too Hot to Handle season 1, where she dated Harry Jowsey, a 25-year-old from Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Both Francesca and Harry made it to the finale of Too Hot to Handle season 1 and received a $7,500 prize as two of the 10 winners.&nbsp;Francesca was also on Too Hot to Handle season 1 with Chloe Veitch, a 23-year-old from Essex, England, who also is a contestant on The Perfect Match season 1. Francesca also starred on the Love Is Blind season 1’s “After the Altar” special, where she dated Damian.</p><p>Who is Damian from The Perfect Match season 1? Damian Powers is a 31-year-old from Heidelberg, Germany. He was originally a contestant on Love Is Blind season 1, where he dated and got engaged to Giannina Gibelli, a 25-year-old from Caracas, Venezuela. Damian listed his job on Love Is Blind season 1 as a “General Manager.” Damian broke up with Giannina at their wedding in the Love Is Blind season 1 finale. In Love Is Blind season 1’s “After the Altar” special, Damian and Giannina revealed they were back together before later breaking up again off camera.</p><h2>Are Dom and Georgia still together from The Perfect Match season 1?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dom-Georgia-Perfect-Match.jpg><p>Relationship status: Broken up</p><p>Are <a href=# rel=noopener>Dom and Georgia still together from The Perfect Match</a> season 1? The answer is no. Dom and Georgia were the winners of The Perfect Match season 1 after they were voted as The Perfect Match in the finale by their fellow contestants. They won a one-week all-expenses paid vacation anywhere in the world. “We won! I did not think that was going to happen. I know you were my perfect match, but I didn’t know we were The Perfect Match,” Georgia told Dom in an interview after they were named the winners.</p><p>Dom and Georgia haven’t confirmed they broke up after The Perfect Match season 1 finished filming in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in March 2023. “I just loved my time with him and getting to know him,” Georgia said. “He’s a great person and I wouldn’t change anything. However, now we’re not together at the moment.” Dom explained that he and Georgia broke up because of distance. Georgia is from Brisbane, Australia, while Dom is from Toronto, Canada. “I think after the show there’s a lot of things that you have to take into account, such as distance. And going from being in a house with cameras around you all the time is tough. We’re on good terms and there’s no bad blood there,” Dom said. “I think it was the kind of thing where, ‘Let’s see where the future leads us. Let’s kind of do our thing on our own.’ If the future has something else in store, if it’s meant to be, then it’s meant to be.”</p><p>The Perfect Match filmed in March 2022, according to an Instagram Story at the time posted by cast member Bartise Bowden, a contestant from Love Is Blind season 3. A month later, in April 2022, news broke that Georgia was dating Harry Jowsey, a contestant from Too Hot to Handle season 1. Harry is also the ex of Francesca Farago, another contestant from Too Hot to Handle season 1, who also starred on The Perfect Match season 1 with Dom and Georgia. (Francesca and Dom were matched before he matched with Georgia.)</p><p>Harry confirmed his and Georgia’s relationship with a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> video of them on the couch together in April 2022. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> in August 2022, Harry confirmed that he and Georgia started dating in April 2022 and had moved in together to his home in Los Angeles. Georgia moved back to her hometown of Brisbane, Australia, in July 2022, and two dated long distance before their split later that year. “She probably wouldn’t want me to say that, but it has been very difficult,” Harry told Page Six about his and Georgia’s long-distance relationship at the time. He explained that the distance had been difficult because the two shared the same love languages: quality time and physical touch.&nbsp;“We take those away, and we have all this distance as being in between us,” he said. “There’s so many factors. I know my audience — they wanna hear that it’s been sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it isn’t. It’s so difficult to have something that’s long distance.”</p><p>He continued, “Thank God I’m leaving tomorrow to go see her, but the distance … it’s been very testing on our relationship because we don’t communicate in the same frequency if that makes sense. Like, she needs a couple of days to cool off things, and I need to get through whatever the issue is like right away so it can stop being serious. So we’ve had a lot of obstacles to overcome.”</p><p>Harry also revealed that he and Georgia fought hours before his Page Six interview because of a TikTok he posted of him direct messaging actress Hailee Steinfeld. “As of this morning, she wasn’t very happy with me ’cause I posted a silly TikTok that I didn’t think about, but we spoke on the phone and we laughed about it, so everything’s OK!” he said. “It was like 5 a.m., and I posted this silly TikTok where I had screenshots of my DMs with Hailee Steinfeld just exposing myself a year ago. I was very cringey. It was just something to look back and laugh at.”</p><p>“[Georgia] didn’t appreciate it. And I was like, ‘You know what, looking back, I wouldn’t appreciate it if you did that, so I apologize.’ I know everyone wants it to be this Instagram, picture-perfect Hollywood couple. I’m like, ‘No, no — we’re trying to figure it out. You got no idea. We’re worse than you guys!’”</p><p>Harry confirmed he and Georgia broke up in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> in November 2022. “At the moment Georgia and I are no longer together, but let me tell you my relationship with her was nothing short of amazing,” he said. “Georgia is such an incredible human being. She is one of the most amazing people I have ever met and I am beyond grateful we crossed paths.” Harry also suggested that part of the reason he and Georgia broke up was because of the pressure from social media.&nbsp;“I think the reason I post so much online is because I love making content. I have typically dated people that are in this same circle/business as I, so they would do so as well,” he said. However because I do open ourselves up to the public, I also open ourselves up to comments and judgment.”</p><p>He also suggested that comparisons between Georgia and Francesca also added to their breakup. “It can definitely be a double-edged sword as you and or the person you are with are constantly compared to the last person your significant other has dated,” he said. “It can be a toll on your mental health and your relationship if you let it get to you. But it is easier said than done. Not letting the media’s opinion get to you can be difficult.”</p><p>He continued, “It takes some getting used to and a lot of clear communication between you and your partner. However, I have also had very private relationships in the past couple of years that have been nothing short of amazing. I have also had some relationships where they were great but upset if I didn’t post about them via social media. It all comes down to the individual and what they need and what you want as a couple. It’s just a balance. But as far as posting about my relationships, I love to share what’s authentic to me and what I feel and want in the moment. I don’t ever plan to post my relationships. I love content and capturing memories and sometimes it just happens.”</p><p>Harry confirmed he and Georgia were back together in February 2023 after he posted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok video</a> of him and Georgia. Harry also reacted to Georgia dating Dom on The Perfect Match in a TikTok video at the time. “When she’s on a dating show and you’re not trying to watch her hook up with other guys,” Harry captioned a video of him and Georgia with the audio, “Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.” As of writing this, Dom and Georgia still follow each other on Instagram.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> in March 2023, Dom explained that long distance was the main reason he and Georgia split. He also confirmed that he and Georgia didn’t even take the all-expenses trip they won after they were named The Perfect Match. “We kept in communication, we tried our best, but I think it just became too much and we just decided to focus on ourselves,” he said. “We don’t know what the future holds. If in the future, we meet back up together and that connection is still strong, then it’s meant to be and it’s there.”</p><p>Georgia, for her part, called Dom a “lovely guy” and wished him “all the best” in her interview with Tudum. (Dom claimed to Tudum that he found out about her relationship with Too Hot to Handle season 1 star Harry Jowsey on a podcast.)</p><p>As for their win, Dom told Tudum that he and Georgia thought there was “no chance” they would be named The Perfect Match. “We were like, ‘There’s no chance,’” Dom said. “And then [Joey] gets down on one knee and we’re like, ‘Yeah. No. This is it.’ We literally looked at each other and were like, ‘It’s fine. We’ll get drunk afterwards.’” Georgia called their win “surreal.”</p><p>Dom also confirmed to Tudum that he’s still single and is open to meeting other Netflix reality TV stars on The Perfect Match season 2. “I don’t know if there’s anyone from Selling Tampa that’s still single, or maybe Cheer,” he said. “Gabi, if she’s single. I don’t know if you’re watching this, but hey, how are you doing? Maybe I’ll see you on Season 2.”</p><p>Who is Dom from The Perfect Match season 1? Dom Gabriel is a 30-year-old from Toronto, Canada. He was originally a contestant on The Mole season 6, where he was eliminated in episode four. Dom listed his job on The Mole as a “Heavy Machine Operator.” Dom was also on The Mole with William Richardson, a 30-year-old from Henderson, Nevada, who was also the winner of season 6.</p><p>Who is Georgia from The Perfect Match season 1? Georgia Hassarati is a 26-year-old from Brisbane, Australia. She was originally a contestant on Too Hot to Handle season 3, which she came in third place.</p><h2><span>Are Joey and Kariselle still together from </span>The Perfect Match<span> season 1?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Joey-Kariselle-Perfect-Match.jpg><p>Relationship status: Broken up</p><p>Are <a href=# rel=noopener>Joey and Kariselle still together from The Perfect Match</a> season 1? The answer is no. Joey and Kariselle were one of five couples in The Perfect Match season 1 finale, along with Dom (The Mole season 1) and Georgia (Too Hot to Handle season 3); Chloe (Too Hot to Handle season 1 and The Circle season 2) and Shayne (Love Is Blind season 2); Bartise (Love Is Blind season 3) and Izzy (Too Hot to Handle season 3); and Nick (The Circle season 1) and LC (Love Is Blind season 1.) Joey and Kariselle also got engaged in The Perfect Match season 1 finale after Joey proposed to Kariselle on their last date. “You’ve been my perfect match since the day I met you. I love waking up to you every single day, and I don’t want that to ever end. I want to ask you: Will you marry me?” Joey told Kariselle in his proposal. “I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and there is no person that I wanna go through life with, besides you.”</p><p>Joey and Kariselle confirmed they broke up after The Perfect Match season 1 finished filming in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in March 2023. “We both sort of agreed right now we need to step away from each other. That’s for the best, but her and I have so much love for each other,” Joey said. Joey explained that he and Kariselle broke up after they returned to the real world. “When I was there, I was like, ‘This is the perfect person I want to spend the rest of my life with.’ When you finish filming, you go back to reality. There’s a lot of life things to deal with,” he said. He continued, “We have been such good friends for such a long time. And as of right now we’re really working on repairing the friendship before anything else.” Still, Joey told Today that he didn’t regret his relationship with Kariselle. “I feel good that since we’ve wrapped the show there hasn’t been any times I’ve been laying in bed going, ‘Why do I say that? Why’d I do that?’” he said. “We took a plunge and it was a great experience.”</p><p>As of writing this, Joey and Kariselle still follow each other on Instagram and have tagged each other in posts about The Perfect Match. In February 2023, Kariselle commented on an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> video of Joey asking people in Times Square, New York, to be his groupie after the show’s Times Square billboard was revealed. “I’m sorry do you forget how we met . . . absolutely iconic,” Kariselle commented with laughing-crying and raised hands emojis. Fans also claimed they saw Kariselle in Joey’s video. “If I’m not mistaken I see [Kariselle] in the reflection of joeys glasses,” one user commented. That same month, Joey posted an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> photo joking that he created an OnlyFans account, to which Kariselle commented, “No fcken way.” Joey responded to Kariselle’s comment with two eyes and laughing-crying emojis.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> in March 2023, Joey explained living in “different places” was the main reason why he and Kariselle split. “You live in different places, you’re trying to get on the same page with each other,” he said, calling their relationship on the show “perfect.” “I think that both of us really respected each other enough to be able to walk away from the situation and really give each other time, distance, space.” He continued, “We love very hard, so the highs are high, and the lows can be very low. At this point, we just know that we’re probably better apart, but that we really want to try to work on our friendship.”</p><p>Joey also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in March 2023 that he and Kariselle “tried to do everything” to stay together before deciding to break up. “Relationships in general are extremely difficult and it’s hard to sit here and say exactly what happened because it’s extremely personal between the both of us,” he said. “We have so much in common, but I just think that we really tried to do everything we could to work on everything. We both had the best of intentions, but we have a lot of differences that separate us with the things that we want and the way that we feel about each other… That chapter of my life is over.”</p><p>Joey, who called himself a “work in progress,” also responded to viewers who speculated that his and Kariselle’s relationship was fake for The Perfect Match. “Not being together shows how real it was because, let’s just be completely honest, if we were going to fake it, this would be the time to fake it — while the show’s airing,” he said. “If you look at shows like The Bachelor, it’s not a coincidence that everyone’s engaged, happy and in love, and then six months after the show, every single one breaks up or ends their engagement. I’m not a person who’s going to fake something for a show. I just always try to lead with my best foot forward.”</p><p>Joey also confirmed that he and Kariselle have a cordial relationship and share “the same attitude toward each other.” “When you watch the show, you can see we’re both very high strung type of people — when things are good, they’re good; when they’re not good, they’re not good,” he said. “I never went out of my way to ever try and hurt somebody. Sometimes when you’re in a new relationship with someone, it feels great. Sometimes you come down from that and it isn’t it for you. All I can ever try to do is be honest about that.”</p><p>When asked about his relationship now, Joey told Variety, “No comment. I have have dated. I have talked to people. I have had those experiences, but I just don’t want to put that out there for the world.”</p><p>Who is Joey from The Perfect Match season 1? Joey Sasso is a 29-year-old from Rochester, New York. He was originally a contestant on The Circle season 1, which he played as himself and won.</p><p>Who is Kariselle from The Perfect Match season 1? Kariselle Snow is a 27-year-old from East Hanover, New Jersey. She was originally a contestant on Sexy Beasts season 1, where she dressed as a panda.</p><h2>Are Chloe and Shayne still together from The Perfect Match season 1</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chloe-Shayne-Perfect-Match.jpg><p>Relationship status: Likely broken up</p><p>Are <a href=# rel=noopener>Chloe and Shayne still together from The Perfect Match</a> season 1? The answer seems to be no. Chloe and Shayne were one of five couples in The Perfect Match season 1 finale, along with Dom (The Mole season 1) and Georgia (Too Hot to Handle season 3); Joey (The Circle season 1) and Kariselle (Sexy Beasts season 1); Bartise (Love Is Blind season 3) and Izzy (Too Hot to Handle season 3); and Nick (The Circle season 1) and LC (Love Is Blind season 1.)</p><p>Chloe and Shayne confirmed they broke up after The Perfect Match season 1 finished filming in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in March 2023. “We’re not together unfortunately,” she said. “Towards the end of the episodes in Perfect Match, there were some bumpy roads, up and down.” Chloe suggested to Today that she and Shayne broke up over his issues with her choosing her ex-boyfriend and Circle season 2 co-star, Mitchell Eason, over him in the middle of The Perfect Match season 1 before Chloe reunited with Shayne toward the end of the season.&nbsp;“When I decided to make him my perfect match, I was feeling very hopeful. When we got outside of the villa, the bubble that we had around us just popped,” she said. She continued, “I will find my perfect match one day.”</p><p>Chloe hinted at the breakup in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> video posted by Shayne’s ex-fiance from Love Is Blind season 2, Natalie Lee, in February 2023. “How long do you kiss your boyfriend?” Natalie lip syncs an audio saying, to which Chloe lip-syncs, “Every week, of course.” Ines, a contestant from The Circle France and another cast member on The Perfect Match season 1, also lip syncs, “What about you?” Natalie responds, “Like four times a week maybe.” Chloe responds, “I didn’t expect that from you and Jake.” Natalie responds, “No, me and Jake are fine. I thought you were asking about your boyfriend.” Chloe, Ines and Natalie then enter the same frame together and lip sync, “Wait what?!”</p><p>In an Instagram Story in January 2023, Natalie claimed that she and Shayne were both approached to be on The Perfect Match season 1 in September 2021 while they were still together, and that Shayne agreed to star on the show without her knowing. “I knew about the new dating show back in Sept 2021 because Shayne and I were both approached to apply for it while we were in a relationship (casting didn’t know we were together at the time),” Natalie wrote in the Instagram Story. “We told each other we declined the opportunity, but I later found out he actually didn’t decline and started the casting process in Nov 2021 without my knowledge at the time, while we were still together. We broke up and cut contact with each other sometime that November” Natalie also claimed that Shayne texted her while filming The Perfect Match and told her that he wanted to leave the show because he “still had feelings” for her after they filmed the Love Is Blind season 2 reunion together.</p><p>“While Shayne was filming the new show in Feb 2022, he texted me numerous times he wanted to leave midway through filming because he still had feelings for me after we saw each other for the first time since our breakup at the reunion show taping,” Natalie wrote. “He also asked for my support as he struggled through the online hate. Knowing there was little hope for our relationship and how excited he was to do another reality tv show, I encouraged him to continue filming and tried to pacify the onlion backlash for him through my interviews and on social media.”</p><p>Natalie also claimed that Shayne asked her to get back together after he finished filming The Perfect Match season 1. “When he returned from filming, he asked to meet up to discuss ‘us’ and ultimately I told him we shouldn’t reconcile. Then he lied about me on a podcast. He apologized for lying on the podcast via text, but any time of friendship we had fell apart as a result.” She continued, “So long story short, in response to how much shayne continued to bully and talk about me and my friends on his social media platforms, I like to spill a little tea once in a while, and yes, he was casting for the show while we were in a relationship in Nov 2021, and I’m really excited to watch the new show because of that fact :)” As of writing this, Chloe and Shayne don’t follow each other on Instagram.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> in March 2023, Chloe explained that she and Shayne broke up after their relationship changed when they returned to the real world.

Comedian Chloe coming at ya!”</p><p>Chloe, who is 23 years old, also told Tudum that she has “baby fever” and wnats to become a mother in the next few years. “I want children by the time I’m 25, 26,” she said. “I can’t look at a baby without wanting to just jump on a man. My ovaries scream when I look at children!”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Her Campus</a> at the time, Chloe called Shayne “the most intense relationship I’ve ever been in.” “Not everyone thought me and Shayne were gonna last,” she said. “And I guess they were right, but I needed to find that out for myself.” She confirmed that she and Shayne don’t have bad blood, “but there [were] a lot of emotions involved, so I feel like it would be impossible to be friends.”</p><p>Who is Chloe from The Perfect Match season 1?

The answer seems to be no. Bartise and Izzy were one of five couples in The Perfect Match season 1 finale, along with Dom (The Mole season 1) and Georgia (Too Hot to Handle season 3); Chloe (Too Hot to Handle season 1 and The Circle season 2) and Shayne (Love Is Blind season 2); Joey (The Circle season 1) and Kariselle (<i>Sexy Beasts</i>); and Nick (The Circle season 1) and LC (Love Is Blind season 1.</p><p>During The Perfect Match season 1 finale, Bartise and Izzy confirmed they planned to date after filming ended. “We had a great date today, talking about future plans, about kids, about our past. I definitely felt the spark increase today,” Bartise said. “I might be making a trip across the pond soon.” When asked if they were the perfect match, both Bartise and Izzy both denied they were. “The time in here has been good. But obviously, distance is a big thing. If one us said we were the perfect match, I don’t think it would be real,” Izzy said, to which Bartise responded, “I think we’re both realistic. She said it first on her date today. I would’ve been surprised if she’d said, ‘You’re my perfect match.'”</p><p>While Bartise and Izzy haven’t confirmed their relationship, it seems like they broke up after The Perfect Match season 1 finished filming but remain on good terms. As of writing this, Bartise and Izzys still follow each other on Instagram.&nbsp;The Perfect Match filmed in March 2022, according to an Instagram Story at the time posted by Bartise. The reunion and “After the Altar” special for Love Is Blind season 3, which Bartise starred on, filmed in fall 2022, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bustle</a>. Bartise suggested he was single on the Love Is Blind season 3 “After the Altar” special after he and his ex-fiance, Nancy Rodriguez, whom he met on the show, discussed their breakup. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in February 2023, Nancy confirmed that she and Bartise are “not friends” following their breakup on Love Is Blind season 3. “<span class=s1>We’re not friends. It’s been a long time,” Nancy said. “Putting myself first and knowing I want to make the best decisions with intention, there are people, not just him, in my life I’ve had to weed out. A lot of that, too, is helping me in my dating world.”</span></p><p><span class=s1>She continued, “Because if you’re not aligning with what I have to offer or you’re not bringing something to the table, what’s something that’s going to better me as a person or in our relationship? I’m sorry, you need to step to the side and I’m gonna keep swiping right until I find somebody who can truly value who I am. But most importantly, they need to know where they’re at. It makes it so much easier to create friendships and relationships with people who are currently healing, currently working on themselves. Because when people are completely unaware, or they don’t know what their actions are doing to other people, and they don’t realize that they’re hurting others, that’s a them problem. I don’t need that in my life. We need you to step aside. The last two years, I have been making room in my life and my heart and my brain space. I’ve been making space for people who have truly loved me for who I am and have cherished that and will help me to be a better Nancy than I already am.”</span></p><p>Nancy also confirmed that she didn’t know Bartise had been cast on The Perfect Match but revealed that she would be open to starring on the show herself. “I’m totally open to other reality TV shows. Love Is Blind was something so unique that I was like, ‘If I get picked for this, this is the one show I would actually do,'” she siad. “Because even going into it, I already felt so close with who I was professionally. Personally, before Love Is Blind, I knew this would be like, ‘Oh, if it happens, it’s an experience, sure.’ But it really did teach me a lot about myself. I’m just so glad I was able to do such a cool experience where I could learn from this, and then just be a better person.”</p><p>When asked if there were any Netflix reality TV stars she was interested in, Nancy responded, “It’s kind of like dating your cousin. I don’t know if I could do that. Because a lot of the girls in the Netflix world, I adore, and I love their personalities on the internet. So I can’t imagine dating one of their exes. It’s messy. But I just think that, at the end of the day, having an open heart and open mind to be even on a dating app, it truly has to be with intention, because you can quickly get lost in the quantity of it all versus the quality.”</p><p>Who is Bartise from The Perfect Match season 1?

We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often.

Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us <span>Weekly</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined Love Is Blind if he was single. “I would. I mean, it’s fascinating,” he said. “Especially having seen the success of season 1 and seeing two loving couples still married to this day? If I watched that and I was looking for love, why wouldn’t you wanna be a part of that? You know, it’s proven to work!” He added, </span>“This dating world is not one I ever was part of — this very superficial ‘swipe left.’ There’s so much judgment and you can Google everybody.
