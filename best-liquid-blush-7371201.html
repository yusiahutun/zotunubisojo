Instead of kicking off a trend, the rise of liquid blush is actually the end-result of our collective shift to pared-back makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Liquid blush has blown up over the last few years because of the switch we've seen on social media for more glowing, natural skin as opposed to heavier full-glam looks,” says celebrity makeup artist Jaleesa Jaikaran. “Liquid blush gives a subtle flush to the cheeks that looks more natural than powder blush.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Liquid blush also tends to be more user-friendly than its powdery peers, since you can easily pop it on with fingers wherever, whenever — in most cases, you can just tap, blend, and go. Another plus: It can be better for certain skin types than, say, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cream blush</a>. Since a liquid blush is so sheer and lightweight, “it’s ideal for someone who tends to get shiny or oily,” says celebrity makeup artist Nick Barose, who counts Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira among his clients. Its popularity has led to a ton of new options, which vary in their color, texture, and overall payoff.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-rare-beauty-soft-pinch-liquid-blush-in-happy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush in Happy</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iNGJK5RPN-ikJnkxo5Z7H4Bpvhg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rare-beauty-soft-pinch-liquid-blush-6d6abe81962647d3ad503e4861648f04.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can choose between two finishes to suit your personal preference.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s so popular that shades are often sold out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Selena Gomez’s makeup line has produced hit after hit, from its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>powder highlighter</a> to its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>priming and setting mist</a>, but few can top the bestseller that is this liquid blush. It’s hard to find someone who isn’t a fan, because it’s just that good. “It adds pretty color and a fresh glow,” says Barose. “It also reflects light a bit, so you get the blush plus a bit of a candlelit glow.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It pairs a weightless feel with buildable color, so you can wear it sheer for a natural flush or apply more for added drama. It blends beautifully, Jaikaran says, and is incredibly pigmented. Heads up, though: While that pigment is a plus, it’s "very easy to go overboard,” says Emily Gray, celebrity makeup artist and ambassador for Catrice Cosmetics, who’s a fan of the radiant finishes in particular.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, proceed with caution to get the most natural finish, knowing you can always add more without it ever getting cakey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 13 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant, matte |<strong> Size: </strong>0.25 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-makeup-revolution-superdewy-liquid-blusher></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup Revolution Liquid Blusher</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup Revolution Superdewy Liquid Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eHD-Wn_ARVojSACoy7Imb3uwzB8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-revolution-superdewy-liquid-blush-f4417189d78047cab13367bf7f0e2b36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolution</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It blends seamlessly over other complexion products without streaking.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s so pigmented that you can overdo it quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's tough to get any beauty product for under $10 these days, much less a highly pigmented, easy-to-blend liquid blush — but that's exactly what you've got with this formula. It's packed with pigment, with shades that are rich enough to show up on even the deepest skin tones, and it's also very buildable, so you can dial up the intensity according to your preference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the finish is more satin than "superdewy" as the name would suggest, it still leaves a luminous sheen on skin with only a few drops, meaning that a single tube will last you a long time. The only drawback is that we’ve found its scent can be a little off-putting, but if you can get over that, then you’ve got yourself a fantastic liquid blush for the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 8 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Dewy |<strong> Size: </strong>0.5 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-giorgio-armani-beauty-a-blush-liquid-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Giorgio Armani Beauty Liquid Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Giorgio Armani Beauty A-Blush Liquid Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nfykweR6Tft3KHu71KYDE5vV-Fk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Giorgio-Armani-Beauty-A-Blush-Liquid-Blush-922e80c8c1284b15a504d916c48cea8b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can’t overdo this sheer option, making it virtually foolproof.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not buildable, so you’re stuck with a soft wash of color until you wash it off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Armani Beauty's Neo Nude collection features water-based products that are intended to melt into skin to add radiance and hydration. That's exactly what its liquid blush does, acting like a watercolor on skin and delivering the ultimate no-makeup makeup look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it's easy to blend, its water-based nature prevents it from being really buildable — you'll still have a softly diffused look no matter how many times you reapply. On the bright side, this makes it pretty much impossible to over-apply, even if you’re heavy-handed. With a built-in doe-foot applicator for precise application, it’s as foolproof as blush gets, making it a fantastic option for anyone new to the liquid blush game.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, the relatively small bottle doesn’t seem to contain a ton of product, so you might have a hard time getting out enough out of there — and it’s not the kind of liquid blush that’s going to last months without requiring a restock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 4 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Dewy |<strong> Size: </strong>0.13 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-milani-cheek-kiss-liquid-blush-makeup></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Milani Cheek Kiss Liquid Blush Makeup</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Milani Cheek Kiss Liquid Blush Makeup" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/k4Ope-D7LatydiQ51bAXVfD7KT4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Milani-Cheek-Kiss-Liquid-Blush-Makeup-6740aef64d3c407e8552e57f6ff71fb0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has great staying power for a liquid blush and can be used on both cheeks and lips.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It can be tough to blend smoothly over some powder foundations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>drugstore blushes</a> tend to come as powders or creams, this liquid number stands out not only for its formula, but because it’s just that good, too. “It blends down seamlessly,” says Jaikaran, who counts it among her favorites. The buildable formula can go from sheer to bold in a matter of seconds with additional layers, and even better, it features nutrient-dense ingredients, like pomegranate and watermelon, to nourish skin, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It also gets bonus points for versatility, since you can use it on both cheeks and lips for a monochromatic look. However, it may inadvertently lift your complexion products, such as foundation and concealer, depending on their formulation. The general rule is to pair like with like, so a liquid blush will blend best over a liquid foundation. But even if you swear by powder or cream foundations, there's not much harm in trying this one out, given its affordability, to see how it works with your overall routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 6 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin |<strong> Size: </strong>0.38 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-glow-charlotte-tilbury-beauty-light-wand></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Glow</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Light Wand</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BEAUTY LIGHT WAND SPOTLIGHT Candlelit gold liquid highlighter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/E0PimfT-JTJ34nRU7RXshAtRYSo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beauty-light-wand-spotlight-candlelit-gold-liquid-highlighter-a1a2d364af1a4e55959420532fed7b2f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charlotte Tilbury</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Since it’s built to be a highlighter, it offers unmatched radiance.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The tube doesn’t house much product and some of what it does have gets soaked into the built-in applicator, giving you even less to work with over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the Light Wand is technically billed as highlighter, two shades — Pinkgasm and Peachgasm —&nbsp;offer an incredible (and incredibly luminous) flush. “They were sold out forever for a reason,” says Gray. “They buff out beautifully and are perfect for a radiant, romantic makeup look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Light Wand has light-reflecting particles for a luminizing effect (that highlighter in action), and the formula is infused with oils to help it melt into skin. Worth keeping in mind, though: Those light-reflecting particles can have a shimmery look to them, which might not be everyone’s preference. The other downside is that the sponge applicator can be unwieldy. “Be sure to carefully close the liquid blush so that it doesn't explode everywhere,” warns Gray.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 6 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant |<strong> Size: </strong>0.41 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-saie-dew-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saie Dew Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saie Dew Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QV1GiSK79wSdqbLMvmSSLlJlgAs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Saie-Dew-Blush-3150e786ce86468cac9cc4149ff16afb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It checks all the boxes: It’s blendable, buildable, and lightweight.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It can disappear quickly on darker skin tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula from clean beauty brand Saie does it all, as far as liquid blushes go. “This gives a fresh finish on the skin that adds a gorgeous soft glow,” says Jaikaran. Its formula has more heft to it than your average liquid — like a cushiony gel — yet it still feels effectively weightless on skin. It also has a plush, doe-foot applicator to help you scale up the intensity. And whether you smooth it in with your fingers, a brush, or makeup sponge, it won't look patchy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For long-term perks, Saie’s Dew Blush also contains a lineup of skincare-minded ingredients, like moisturizing evening primrose oil and antioxidant-packed elderberry. However, the pigment itself, while rich when you first apply it, doesn’t seem to hold up during the day without a touch-up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 6 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Dewy |<strong> Size: </strong>0.40 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pigmented-benefit-cosmetics-benetint-liquid-lip-blush--cheek-tint></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pigmented</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Benefit Cosmetics Benetint Lip & Cheek Tint</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Benefit Cosmetics Benetint Liquid Lip Blush &amp;amp; Cheek Tint" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5SJ68o8F47k0ItQ9NVXv3BdTQbM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/benefit-cosmetics-benetint-cheek--lip-stain-2809e51852d547bcb9c487c3a7f746fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is a true liquid blush that sets quickly and lasts all day.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It can highlight different textures on skin, including blemishes and fine lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More of a cheek stain than a blush, Benetint was one of the first in the category (and some millennials might recognize it from their high-school days). Designed for both lips and cheeks, it has a super-light, almost watery texture that feels like nothing on your skin. Thanks to that lightweight nature, it delivers more of a hint of color versus a colorful flush, although you can build it up for more impact.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike its creamier counterparts, Benetint won't move once it sets, so you can rest assured that your pop of color will last all day (and then some). However, because it's a classic and the formula has remained virtually untouched over the years, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles as the newcomers, like skincare benefits or a luminous finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also good to keep in mind: It can bring out bumps and creases in skin, so if you’re dealing with a breakout, you might want to skip it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 5 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin |<strong> Size: </strong>0.2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-nars-liquid-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NARS Liquid Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nars Cosmetics Liquid Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GPkCbRbWlDKYpbiIsL0qbhSEveE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nars-Cosmetics-Liquid-Blush-b56de2e8d0704b369bee5d82a703065f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can find it in bestselling shades of NARS other popular blush shades, like Orgasm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The packaging is prone to spilling and isn’t travel-friendly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NARS is known for its blushes (exhibit A: Its Orgasm powder blush, which was a runaway success), so it’s no surprise that the brand would get into the liquid blush game. Naturally, you can find it in the signature peachy-pink shade of Orgasm, as well as a handful of other favorites, like Dolce Vita.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Its thin, liquid-y feel is supremely easy to blend, possibly because of the addition of moisturizing monoï and tamanu oils, both of which can be found throughout the brand's entire line of liquid blush. Yet the pigments are what we love the most — they're rich, luminous, and full-bodied enough that they show up on all skin tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the pump format of the bottle makes it easy to dispense either a small drop for a natural flush or full pump for extra drama, that's pretty much all the credit the packaging gets.

While this oil-free blush (which, by the way, can be used on eyes and lips) offers soft, glassy color in a mere seconds, it also doubles as a serum, courtesy of its skincare-quality ingredients. It's packed with hyaluronic acid, along with a lineup of many other natural moisturizers to nourish skin over time, leaving it feeling softer and smoother all day long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This blush is brimming with translucent pigments to allow your natural skin tone to shine through.

A sheer formula this is not — rather, the liquid blush is dripping with color, so much so that an initial application will get you a bold wash of pigment. But if you want a more subtle look, a workaround is simple: Just apply it to the back of your hand first to diffuse it or mix it with a makeup primer. Either way you want to style it, you'll find that it's a breeze to blend in, making for an overall more dramatic payoff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also adore the brand's diverse shade range in a variety of unique blush hues. Each shade can be applied to the eyes and lips in addition to the cheeks. The only way it falls short is with the tube, which can get coated with extra product and leak.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 8 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte, radiant |<strong> Size: </strong>0.21 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-blendable-tarte-blush-tape-liquid-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Blendable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Blush Tape</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Blush Tape Liquid Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6YbRsCob_1-Hdff3acnIDGYMtJU=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tarteblushtapeliquidblush-8fd594070c1841fe957f388d122c9306.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tarte</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This blush is a nearly universal crowdpleaser, delivering a lit-from-within glow without any glitter or excess shine.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The formula is so sheer that you might go through a tube ASAP and the lighter hues might not show up on deeper skin tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The latest drop from Tarte goes big on luminosity without veering into shimmer territory.

Although it’s sold as a lip mousse, “the formula that can be used on both cheeks and lips,” says Barose. “It’s richly pigmented and easy to blend, with a velvety finish that’s matte, but fresh and not dull.” It blends seamlessly no matter where you apply it, and, unlike some matte formulations, doesn't feel dry or cakey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it dries to a stain-like finish on the skin, it’s not as long-lasting as some other liquid blushes, and the angled applicator can make it tough to get enough product out of the tube. But, since all you need is a few dots, it shouldn’t be a huge issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 18 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte |<strong> Size: </strong>0.21 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ilia-color-haze-multi-matte-pigment></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ilia Multi-Matte Pigment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ilia Color Haze Multi-Matte Pigment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pEGNWtUnpZopX0yVf93q_qJ54rw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ilia-Color-Haze-Multi-Matte-Pigment-2f4b8bec3229462aaf0286ff3aca802e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pigment offers two finishes in one, depending on where you apply it.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It doesn’t have much staying power, so you might need a touch-up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This hybrid can go just about anywhere you want it, be it the lips, cheeks, or eyes. As a cheek color, however, it layers well and sinks into skin quickly. And although it settles into a matte texture on the lips, it stays radiant on the skin.

Choosing the right finish depends partly on the look you’re going for and partly on your skin type.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Dewy blushes give the glow, but also can make you look oily — so it’s best for dry skin,” Barose says. “Mattes are great if you have texture like large pores and acne, in which case you don’t want glow or shimmer as it brings out the bumpy textures more.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile dewy and radiant finishes — radiance being more about brightness than hydration —&nbsp;are a great bet if you’re looking for a more luminous look, ideal if your skin leans dry or dull. “I love blushes with a bit of radiance to them,” says Gray. “I love glow and combining blush and highlight.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, shimmery finishes are in a league of their own. They tend to make more of a statement versus the liquid blushes that impart a natural finish. Liquid blushes with a shimmer are meant to be seen and to add a light-catching sheen to skin. For that reason, they're “perfect for evenings, not daytime,” says Barose.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shade</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like eyeshadow and eyeliner, there are no real limitations to what liquid blush shade is best for your skin tone. “You can wear any shade — just choose the right intensity of the shade you’re going for,” says Jaikaran. If you have fair skin and have your heart set on a bold berry blush, then go for it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, certain shades may enhance the cheeks or offer better payoff if you choose them strategically. For instance, for those who are fair, “light pinks and corals look gorgeous on lighter skin tones,” says Jaikaran, who adds they'll have the most natural effect, as though you’re actually blushing for whatever reason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, “medium tones can be orange-y or deep pink,” says Barose, who uses these types of colors on actress Gugu Mbatha Raw. “Make sure the color is rich enough and that once blended down, there’s some punch to it.” These more saturated hues will not only show up on medium or tan skin tones, but will bring out a glow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, for those with dark skin, he recommends reaching for deep plums and burnt coral shades. “It needs to look really deep so it translates on dark skin,” he says. What’s as important, too, is that your liquid blush formula has the necessary pigment needed to pull that off.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Blendability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Liquid blushes tend to be super-concentrated, which is why you can usually find them in tiny tubes and bottles. And because a single dab will usually have a ton of pigment, a blendable formula is key. “They have to be easily buffed out with either a dense brush, beauty blender, or your fingers,” says Gray. “I also like when the first layer of blush is sheerer, so that I can build the product up. If there is too much pigment, it does not look as seamless.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But whatever you do, don’t let a bright color on the packaging make you nervous. “The thing with liquid blush is that you always want to go brighter in the packaging, because once it’s blended in, it will add the right pop,” says Barose. Plus, liquid blushes tend to be on the sheer side, so the color, as bold as it may look in the tube, will be softened and diffused on your skin.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What's the best way to apply liquid blush?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">First, keep in mind: Less is more, so start with the smallest amount possible and take it from there, especially if it’s your first time using it. “This will help you achieve a natural-looking flush without going overboard,” says Jaikaran.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Then, once you’ve added a dot to your skin, blend it out using your fingers, a fluffy brush, or a makeup sponge.

Rather, it just has a different, thinner texture that can be watery, cushiony, or gel-like as opposed to creamy. Both offer easy, seamless application and blending.
