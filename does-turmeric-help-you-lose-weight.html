And one of the spices that’s got the biggest buzz when it comes to weight loss is turmeric. If you’ve ever wondered, ‘Does turmeric help you lose weight?’ you’ve come to the right place. We talked to top doctors and weight-loss experts to get the answer. And it’s good news! “You can use foods and spices to help you better manage your weight,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Melina Jampolis, MD</a>, a weight-loss doctor and author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spice Up, Slim Down</a>. “I’m a big believer in making small changes that can add up to optimize your health.”</p><p>Read on to learn about the fat-melting, metabolism-revving powers of turmeric and other spices hiding in your spice rack. And keep scrolling to learn how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Karrie Blew</a> lost 55 pounds with turmeric.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How turmeric helps you lose weight</h2><p>You know that potent flavor of yellow curry sauce in a rice dish? That’s turmeric. This golden spice, commonly used in Indian cooking, is super healthy. It is bursting with anti-aging and antioxidant properties, thanks to its active compound, curcumin. It stands above all other spices in many ways, including its ability to reduce LDL cholesterol.</p><p>Dr. Jampolis says, “It’s a special spice that has been found to be tremendously effective in reducing and preventing inflammation.” Research shows that inflammation can trigger a cascade of hormonal and cellular changes that can damage the body. But health experts also know that decreasing inflammation can improve metabolic problems that might be stalling or blocking our weight loss progress.</p><p>Dr. Jampolis says, “For optimal absorption in the body, consume turmeric with a little bit of healthy fat and a pinch of black pepper, which contains a compound called <a href=#>piperine</a> that helps increase the absorption of the curcumin in turmeric by up to 2,000%!”</p><p>Try sprinkling the spice into rice dishes, soups or sauces. Some women enjoy drinking “golden” coffee drinks with turmeric. Or reach for ready-made treats like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Get Golden</a> snack bars, made with turmeric.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More weight-loss spices</h2><p>Turmeric isn’t the only spice known to help people lose weight.

But how does it help with weight loss? The key is the way ginger functions as a thermogenic food, or something that creates heat within the body. “It helps raise up your body temperature, which will increase your calorie burn,” says biochemist and doctor of clinical nutrition <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dee McCaffrey</a>, DCN, the host of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Diet Science”</a> &nbsp;podcast and author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Science of Skinny</a>. As a result: “I call it a fat-burning super spice.”</p><p>Bonus: Ginger is also known to be good for the liver, the organ in charge of detoxing fat and toxins from the body. Try a mug of ginger tea or grate fresh ginger into soups or stir fry dishes.

Cinnamon’s power lies in its ability to help stabilize blood sugar levels. In fact, consuming just 1/4 tsp. to 1/2 tsp can have a positive effect, especially on people suffering from insulin resistance, a condition where insulin can’t make its way into cells. McCaffrey explains, “Cinnamon works because it mimics the actions of insulin.” Try adding cinnamon to oatmeal, yogurt or coffee drinks.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Astonishing Health Benefits of Saigon Cinnamon</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Garlic</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Thana-Prasongsin.jpg><p>Garlic is a favorite among home cooks, but it can do more than deliver flavor. It can speed weight loss. “We call garlic the mighty metabolism defender with a heart-protective effect,” says McCaffrey.</p><p>Here’s how: Garlic is rich in a sulfur-containing bioactive called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allicin</a>, which is known for its metabolism-boosting abilities. It encourages the breakdown of fat so it can be shuttled off to use for energy rather than stored in extra pounds. As for the heart-healthy part: McCaffrey adds, “Garlic is also renowned for its ability to help with blood circulation, which facilitates the metabolic processes that increase your metabolism.” To get more of this spice in your life, finely chop fresh garlic and toss it into casseroles, sauces, soups or even in scrambled eggs.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Dentist-Recommended Tips to Get Rid of Garlic Breath —&nbsp;and the Pre-Meal Snack That Prevents the Problem</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cayenne pepper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/SGAPhoto.jpg><p>This spicy-hot seasoning is powerful, due to its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">capsaicin</a>, known to prod the body to burn calories for body heat. University of Maryland scientists say it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">raises metabolism</a> by 25% for 3 hours after ingesting. This pepper also neutralizes internal acid, reducing inflammation. Sprinkle cayenne into Mexican dishes, soups or meat chili.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Adding Hot Sauce (Yes, Really!)

This mineral is vital to the health of our thyroid gland. “The thyroid really is the master controller of metabolism. It produces thyroid hormones, which are sent to all the cells of the body and signal the cells on how fast they’re going to convert your food into energy,” explains McCaffrey. Consider adding flavorful mustard seeds to salad dressings and sauces.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This Trace Soil Element Could Be Just What Your Thyroid Is Crying Out For</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Success story: Karrie Blew, 68</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/2249-Diet-RL.png><p>Up, up, up. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Karrie Blew</a> watched as her blood pressure climbed after she was sidelined from her job by an injury. She knew losing weight could help, but she told herself, It’s not as if I haven’t tried. Nothing works…</p><p>For 15 years, Karrie had been gaining weight and trying every diet plan and diet pill she could find, to no avail. Then she read an article in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woman’s World</a> about how certain foods could work as powerful medicine to target fat, decrease inflammation, even slow aging genes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The right ingredients changed everything</h2><p>Inspired, Karrie made it a game to work as many of these healing foods into each meal. She reached for resveratrol-rich red grapes, berries, nuts and dark chocolate. She also developed her own powerful spice blend containing turmeric to use every time she cooked.</p><p>Karrie lost 8 pounds the first week. While nibbling on dark chocolate chips, she noted, “They tasted so good, you would never know they turned on your ‘skinny genes’ and caused you to lose weight!”&nbsp;</p><p>In five months, Karrie dropped 55 pounds, flattened her tummy and lowered her blood pressure. Next, she helped her husband get back to his high-school weight and her daughter beat cancer, all with the healing power of food.&nbsp;</p><p>Karrie says, “During the pandemic, so many people gained weight, but not me. I learned to burn fat faster than ever. My figure looks like I’m 20!”</p><p>This content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
