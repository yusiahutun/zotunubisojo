I saw it, threw it down and said, 'no, no, no'. It was the final straw for me. It was awful.</p><p>“It was so small and disgusting. It's now my new go to to tell their mums on them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000617945357.jpg><p>"I didn't know him. He had messaged me. I responded to his messages saying 'how are you'. I looked back and there was a penis on my phone.</p><p>"I literally said, 'what the f***'. It's so gross. After I told him I messaged his mum I blocked him. He had started to type and reply, but I blocked him before he could send it.”</p><p>Shannai found his mum on Facebook, who shockingly tried to defend her son’s actions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000617947369.jpg><p>Shannai penned a message, saying: “I just wanted you to know your son thinks it's okay to send women pictures of his penis for literally no reason at all.</p><p>"You seem like a wonderful lady so I know you didn't raise him to do things like that.</p><p>"I think maybe you should remind to treat women with the same respect he would want you to be treated with."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000617942573.jpg><p>But she didn’t get a positive response originally, as his mum claimed it wasn’t him that sent the snap.&nbsp;</p><p>Shannai said: “When I messaged his mum she was like, 'he's been hacked', but he was talking to me before and is in the picture.</p><p>"She finally was like, 'I will handle this'. At first she denied it but then she said she wasn't trying to raise him like that. I think he's in his 20s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000617942797.jpg><p>"He's not 16 anymore. He needs to grow up."</p><p>Shannai shared screengrabs from her chat with the lad’s mum, where the parent wrote: “Someone hacked his account last year and sent these kind[s] of photos to almost everyone on his friends list. When was the pic sent?"</p><p>Shannai replied: "Just now. It was him because we were just talking. Then he sent that."</p><p>The mother then wrote "Ok, I apologise."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/069e6faf-dc03-4f14-8260-c412e069aa1c.jpg><p>Shannai shared her ordeal on social media as a warning to people who think it’s acceptable to send unwanted nudes, as she vowed to deal with future snaps in the same way.&nbsp;</p><p>Her post racked up thousands of likes and comments, as she wrote: “So today this random dude sent me a picture of his peen out of the clear blue sky so I found his mom on here and told her.</p><p>"It’s 2020. Everything is already going horribly. Don’t make me get your mom on you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/c28ec1c9-e2be-4bf4-9211-76c7c245ca33.jpg><p>But the mum later tried to defend her son even further, saying: "I feel this has gotten way out of hand. The truth is that my son didn't intend to send this young lady [pictures] of his genital part.</p><p>"I am so embarrassed but we all get peen pic. I feel this young lady open wounds and my son actions triggered [them]. [sic]</p><p>"Of course, I don't condone my son acting like a creep.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000617941502.jpg><p>But she claimed Shannai was “trolling” him, and she likened sharing the messages online to ‘cyber bullying’, adding it ‘doesn’t solve anything’.&nbsp;</p><p>She continued: “Two wrongs do not make anything right. All wom[e]n get sent d*** pics, but thank goodness for the good old delete and block feature.</p><p>"He has learned his lesson. He has nothing else to say about this. He is sorry if he hurt anyone."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000617944839.jpg><p>Shannai later added: “When I made the post she was upset because she thought it made her look bad. There's no one saying that though.</p><p>"I know I'm not perfect either, but I'm not sending pictures of my vagina into the world. No one wants to deal with that.</p><p>"There's going to be somebody out there who wants to see it. Don't give it away for free.</p><p>"Get an Only Fans account or something. Somebody wants to pay to see it. Get money to show off your junk."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Meanwhile this <a href=#>woman stunned after she texted builder to ask why he walked out part way through a job and gets a very creepy reply</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Plus this&nbsp;<a href=#>woman has the best comeback for a creepy bloke who asked to see her wearing a bikini she was selling</a>.</p><p>And a&nbsp;<a href=#>woman receives a wrong number text about someone’s cheating boyfriend</a>&nbsp;and sends the perfect response back.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mortified woman sends mates a text asking for ‘permission to hook up’ with a guy… then realises she’s used her family chat instead</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BsZ3FtZWd%2BcMPOppinZaWjxKK6056bZqiVo7a0ec%2Bimmaqlauyr7PEZqSupV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./7-online-resources-trace-history-house.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Trace the History of Your House: The 7 Best Sites">&larr;
