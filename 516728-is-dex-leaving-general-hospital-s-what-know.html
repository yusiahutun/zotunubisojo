But recently, there have been rumours about his potential departure from the iconic soap opera. This is because of the show's suspenseful storyline that has taken an intriguing turn, plus he wasnâ€™t part of the photo of the opening credits. So, is Dex leaving <i>General Hospital</i>?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dbad05e150001086.jpg><p class=align-left>Dex is one of the key and finest characters in <i>General Hospital</i>. His outstanding acting skills have captivated fans and added depth to the show. Dex was introduced in the long-running soap opera on 6th May 2022.</p><h2>Who is Dex working for on General Hospital?</h2><p class=align-left>Dex is working for both Sonny Corinthos and Michael Corinthos. He was brought in the 60-year-old daytime drama as a temporary replacement for Chet Driscoll, where he manages Sonny Corinthos gym.

Dex's job was to find solid/ strong evidence against Michael's dad, Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Bernard). With the evidence, Michael would put Sonny behind bars for a long time.</p><p class=align-left>In the process, Dex Heller and Michael's sister, and Sonny's ex-stepdaughter, Joss (Josslyn Jacks), fell deeply in love. At first, they kept the relationship a secret because Sonny and Michael never wanted Dex Heller anywhere near Josslyn. But with time, they could not hide their overwhelming love and decided to date openly.</p><p class=align-left>Sonny Corinthos was upset with Dex for keeping the relationship a secret, but he later gave them his blessings. But it's most certainly because Dex saved his life.

He can stay and legitimately work for Sonny and hope he doesn't find out about his initial plans. Or he can run away from the scandalous Port Charles, never to be seen by anyone, including his newfound lover Josslyn and boss, Sonny.</p><p class=align-left><i>General Hospital</i> previews indicate that Dex told his <a href=#>new girlfriend</a>, Joss, he has to leave. In addition, rumours hint that Joss has promised to stand by his lover and go with him. However, there is no information regarding any potential exits of Dex and Josslyn in <i>General Hospital</i>.</p><h2>Why is Dex not on opening credits on General Hospital?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eb52121b3e932301.jpg><p class=align-left>Dex and some popular <i>General Hospital</i> characters, including Portia and Trina, were not part of the opening credits photo, which made a buzz online.

That's because <i>General Hospital </i>has a <a href=#>massive cast</a> and thus can't include everyone in the limited-time opening. They usually stick to characters that will be prominent in the episode.</p><h2>Who is the new Dex on General Hospital?</h2><p class=align-left>The daytime <a href=#>soap opera</a> newcomer is Evan Hoffer. He plays Dex, the guy who works as a double agent in Sonny's <a href=#>business</a>. However, recently there have been rumours among fans that Evan Hoffer might be leaving the show for good. But this information hasn't been officially confirmed by <i>General Hospital</i>.</p><h2>Final word on Dex in General Hospital</h2><p class=align-left>Lately, fans have asked, "Is Dex leaving <i>General Hospital</i>?" Dex (Evan Hoffer) was the latest actor to be added to the <i>General Hospital</i> cast. It was a temporary role, but his incredible performances got him a deal with the show.
