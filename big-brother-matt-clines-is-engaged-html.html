He stayed relatively silent as he seemed focused on his showmance with Raven Walton and notably blew up his game to save her. After dating for around a year, the couple eventually called it quits. In 2020, he began a relationship and proposed to his girlfriend on <a href=#>New Year’s Day</a> in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Big-Brother-Matt-Clines.jpg><h2 id=h-matt-clines-reveals-engagement-to-girlfriend><strong>Matt Clines reveals engagement to girlfriend</strong></h2><p id=par-2_41>On New Year’s Day 2022,&nbsp;Big Brother 19&nbsp;star Matt Clines&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced his engagement</a>&nbsp;to his girlfriend, Annabel Lauren. Posting a picture of himself kneeling in front of her with an open ring box, Matt simply captioned it, “told ya,” with a winking eye emoji.</p><p id=par-3_17>A few of his former housemates, including Elena Davies, Kevin Schlehuber, and <a href=#>winner Josh Martinez,</a> commented congratulations.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_46>While it’s unclear exactly when he and Annabel, 25, began dating, their first picture posted to his Instagram account dates back to a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">July 4, 2020 hangout</a>&nbsp;in Washington, D.C. The two have vacationed together as they’ve visited Miami Beach and Scottsdale, Arizona, during the summer of 2021.</p><p id=par-5_23>A few months after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attending a wedding together,</a>&nbsp;they announced their engagement, following around a year-and-a-half of dating. The couple currently lives in Arlington, Virginia.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>He previously dated former houseguest Raven Walton</strong></h2><p id=par-6_21>In 2017, he met Arkansas-based dance teacher Raven Walton during&nbsp;<a href=#>Big Brother 19</a>. The two almost instantly connected and started a showmance.</p><p id=par-7_30>Although viewers usually enjoy watching romantic connections blossom in the house, many fans, and other competitors, were annoyed with the couple as they seemed more interested in dating than competing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_44>Throughout her time on the show, Raven told several stories about her several alleged injuries and health injuries that viewers and other houseguests found themselves questioning. However, after the season, he defended his girlfriend during an interview with Entertainment Tonight, insisting he believed her.</p><p id=par-9_42>The two continued their relationship following their exit, and Matt frequently updated viewers on her health. After dating for around a year, the couple quietly split as fans noticed Matt updated his status to single. According to reports, they have remained friends.</p><h2><strong>Matt finished ‘Big Brother 19’ in 8th place</strong></h2><p id=par-10_25>Mostly remembered for his notable romance and penchant for eating copious amounts of cereal, the “Silver Fox” initially <a href=#>joined Cody Nickson’s</a> alliance consisting of showmances.</p><p id=par-11_32>However, he soon teamed up with Paul Abrahamian and voted with him. Matt remained under the radar until Week 9, when then-Head of Household Jason Dent nominated him and Raven for eviction.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-12_55>Initially believing they were pawns, the two realized he intended to split them up after choosing not to use the Power of Veto. Therefore, Matt decided to sacrifice his game for her by breaking the rules as a Have-Not resulting in a penalty vote. Additionally, he picked a fight with Jason to ensure his eviction.</p><p id=par-13_28>It worked as the others unanimously voted him out of the house, and he became the fourth member of the jury, finishing in 8th place.&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;airs on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvqrOMm6morJiav265wK2rZpucnrumv4yiqmadnpyuqLHDZ5%2BtpZxk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./doug-batchelor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doug Batchelor">&larr;
