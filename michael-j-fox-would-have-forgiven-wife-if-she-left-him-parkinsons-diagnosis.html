"I love Tracy, obviously, and she's an amazing person and has gone through a lot. I realize she has a life separate from me having Parkinson's, separate from me being Alex Keaton or Marty McFly, she's a person. I think that's why it's gone okay."</p><p>The Family Ties star continued, "She had indicated to me by saying, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health. She was able to get me through it, and go through it with me. And she has for 35 years."</p><p>"We knew the bus was coming and we knew it was going to hit, but we didn't know how far away it was or how fast it was going," Fox added. "At any time, she would have been forgiven to say, 'I'm just gonna step out.' But, she didn't do that."</p><p>The Back to the Future actor and Pollan, 63, married in 1988. The couple shares four children: son Sam, 34, twin daughters Aquinnah and Schuyler, 28, and daughter Esme, 21.</p><p>Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991 when he was only 29. He founded the research foundation, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, in 2000.</p><p>Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that causes unintentional and uncontrollable movements that often involves shaking, stiffness and poor balance and coordination. Though symptoms start gradually, the effects of the disease worsen over time and eventually lead to difficulty walking and talking.</p><a id=gallery-link-a52733cb-fc29-42d5-9b23-d5334de9e0fa class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:a52733cb-fc29-42d5-9b23-d5334de9e0fa data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c6296136-9745-4d4f-bc98-91ded29bd621 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/57/4by3/2023/11/06/57cac79b27a244f39779054eda06707c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmamhforaktMCeo2aiXZu8uXnWqKylnF2drrexjJ%2Bmq5%2BZq7KvedainZ5lmZt6tLTEZqOenqRitaq5jKmYq6OZo8CwutJmm6KZl6O8tLXSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./65517a26268e3ec97d8b4583-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrick Mahomes' trainer blasts Joe Burrow &amp;amp; Bengals after Texans loss">&larr;
