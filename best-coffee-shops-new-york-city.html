This minimalistic coffee shop offers global publications and local art for viewing, stark white exposed brick walls and signature tortoise shell spoons for sale–in addition to a delicious espresso. Relax with your Flat White (the Aussie version of a latte and Happy Bones' specialty!) with the morning paper; when you order, select from a wide variety of milks (yay for dairy-free diners!). While here, you're bound to run into tons of downtown NYC creatives, and start your morning off on the right foot.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.happybonesnyc.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Happy Bones" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Happy Bones</a>, 394 Broome Street, New York, NY 10013</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Birch</h2><img alt="Wood, Drink, Amber, Glass, Drinkware, Cocktail, Tumbler, Alcoholic beverage, Alcohol, Tan, " data-cy=slide-image-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-coffee-birch-3-1496702770.jpg title="Wood, Drink, Amber, Glass, Drinkware, Cocktail, Tumbler, Alcoholic beverage, Alcohol, Tan, " width=630 height=472 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scattered all around the city, Birch is a convenient coffee shop with various types of coffee, lots of space to sit and work, and laid-back, rustic furniture. They have various non-dairy milk options–including hemp milk–and pride themselves on creating a sense of community amidst the chaos of New York City. Their "Ignition Initiative" encourages patrons to mingle; cups have "Hello my name is___," printed on them, and their Ignition Initiative cards provide a great topic to talk about which you can place on your table to welcome conversation. If you're not looking for a quiet place to work, Birch does more than coffee, helping you connect with others in a city where the fast-pace can make it difficult to make friends. With that said, if you're after a place to focus and sit on your laptop, they've got that on offer as well.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For locations, visit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://birchcoffee.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=birchcoffee.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">birchcoffee.com</a>.</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Maman</h2><img alt="Serveware, Dishware, Ingredient, Plate, Food, Tableware, Dish, Meal, Cuisine, Recipe, " data-cy=slide-image-3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pistachio-and-creme-brulee-croissants-collage-2-victoria-morris-1496703306.jpg title="Serveware, Dishware, Ingredient, Plate, Food, Tableware, Dish, Meal, Cuisine, Recipe, " width=2500 height=1667 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maman is basically Instagram heaven. With their classic blue floral printed to-go coffee cups, rustic decor and 'grammable props abound, you could spent countless hours here sipping cappuccinos, dining on delicious French fare, and filling your feed with killer shots of all the action. If you like hot chocolate, order their lavender-infused version, which is an impressive balance of rich and herbal flavors. Hungry? You're in luck; here, they serve brunch in the back and you can order quiches and pastries to stay. During the day, you'll likely spot the well-heeled freelancers of NYC sitting on the rustic furniture among the potted plants and string lights, working and relaxing with their hot drink of choice. Step inside any of Maman's various locations around the city–they just opened up a Meatpacking District location–with its blue tiled floors and white washed wood panels and after a sip or two, you may begin to feel like you are in the South of France. Warning to those who fall in love with this quaint spot during the work week: this hotspot fills up fast on weekends.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For locations, visit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mamannyc.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=mamannyc.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">mamannyc.com</a>.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Sant Ambroeus</h2><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This may not be just a coffee shop, but this ristorante's authentic stand-up espresso bar at any of its many locations across Manhattan and the Hamptons make for some of the best Instagram moments, and some of the best cappuccinos. There is something sweet and magical about the espresso drinks here; they are absolutely delicious. Head here in the morning or midday for a pick me up, order a latté, double espresso or cappuccino to stay or to go. Don't be surprised if you spot Bella, Gigi, Kendall or Emrata grabbing a bite to eat while you sip your frothy fix–they're all regulars.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For locations, visit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.santambroeus.com/ristorante.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=santambroeus.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">santambroeus.com</a>.<br></p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Coffee Project</h2><img alt="Drink, Stemware, Glass, Champagne stemware, Wine glass, Drinkware, Tableware, Distilled beverage, Liqueur, Table, " data-cy=slide-image-5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-coffee-coffee-project-1496702771.jpg title="Drink, Stemware, Glass, Champagne stemware, Wine glass, Drinkware, Tableware, Distilled beverage, Liqueur, Table, " width=900 height=900 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the mood for a deconstructed latte? Or, never heard of one? We're guessing it's the latter. Here, try the Project One and the Nitro Coffee. We won't take all the fun out of it, but the Project One consists of one shot espresso, a shot of steamed milk, a latte cup, a glass of sparkling water and a little waffle cookie. The baristas here are knowledgable and explain everything to you as you go, as any bartender, mixology master or cocktail artist might after hours. If you are looking for a place that takes coffee seriously and serves up new takes on classics you think you know all too well, this is it.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.coffeeprojectny.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Coffee Project" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Coffee Project</a>, 239 E 5th Street, New York NY 10003</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Summers NYC</h2><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A little slice of California sunshine beams out of this cheerful little nook of a cafe in SoHo. The simple decor of succulents inside hollowed out coconuts, surf boards, sunscreen and more makes the simple joys of picking up an iced latte, a cold pressed juice or a cold brew easy breezy. A variety of milks available in palm leaf decorated Swell bottles are ready for use and this grab-and-go spot's simple menu of light bites like classic avocado toast and refreshing acai bowls make picking what to eat a tough call–but delicious no matter what you choose. The coffee here is smooth and flavorful, roasted directly at Devocion in Brooklyn.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.summersbrooklyn.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Summers NYC" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Summers NYC</a>, 169 Thompson St, New York, NY 10012</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Dover Street Market’s Rose Bakery</h2><img alt="Furniture, Interior design, Table, Room, Chair, Building, Restaurant, Design, Architecture, Floor, " data-cy=slide-image-7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-coffee-dover-street-1496702772.jpg title="Furniture, Interior design, Table, Room, Chair, Building, Restaurant, Design, Architecture, Floor, " width=1600 height=1160 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">World famous concept store, Dover Street Market, houses the Rose Bakery, which is a fresh break from the avant garde shop's eclectic retail experience.

The decor of the La Colombe cafes are clean and minimalistic, so you can focus on their amazing coffee. This hotspot's three locations are always, always packed, especially in SoHo, but luckily, the baristas run a tight ship here–so you won't ever be waiting too long. If you find yourself standing on a long line here for an espresso or pour over, keep in mind that the beans are worth the wait. The coffee and espresso drinks here are complex and flavorful. Try the draft latte, its insanely frothy and utterly delicious. If you're looking for something sweet to pair it with, the olive oil cake is a must.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For locations, visit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lacolombe.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=lacolombe.com data-vars-ga-product-id=56ac0611-93af-4681-bf90-f0d99156fca7 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.lacolombe.com data-product-url=https://www.lacolombe.com data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lacolombe.com" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-media-role=1 data-vars-ga-media-type=Slide data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=db61f8b4-d3a7-438b-ba91-8155df3e196e class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">lacolombe.com</a>.</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Hi-Collar</h2><img alt="Barware, Hand, Alcohol, Drink, Alcoholic beverage, Glass, Distilled beverage, Drinkware, Bottle, Nail, " data-cy=slide-image-9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-coffee-hicollar-1496702772.jpg title="Barware, Hand, Alcohol, Drink, Alcoholic beverage, Glass, Distilled beverage, Drinkware, Bottle, Nail, " width=1638 height=1092 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coffee at Hi-Collar is all about the experience.

Not sure what to go for? The baristas here are some of the friendliest in the city, and will definitely give their advice on what to drink and how best to enjoy it. Pull up a chair at this counter to pay $7 to sip coffee from a $700 gold leafed Christofle cup.

This coffee shop is no-fuss and all about the java; if you're a serious coffee lover from the west coast, this place has your name on it (since you may recognize it from its SF and LA outposts).</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For NYC and Brooklyn locations, visit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bluebottlecoffee.com/store data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=bluebottlecoffee.com data-vars-ga-product-id=f566a64f-402c-47ec-a19f-599d62b3517b data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://bluebottlecoffee.com/store data-product-url=https://bluebottlecoffee.com/store data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbluebottlecoffee.com%2Fstore" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-media-role=1 data-vars-ga-media-type=Slide data-vars-ga-product-brand=coffee data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e3b7cf64-6abe-412f-bfb2-4fc652759e89 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=coffee class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">bluebottlecoffee.com</a>.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Stumptown Coffee Roasters @ Ace Hotel</h2><img alt="Reflection, Iron, Window, Building, Glass, Facade, Architecture, Display window, Urban area, Font, " data-cy=slide-image-16 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-coffee-stumptown-1496702772.jpg title="Reflection, Iron, Window, Building, Glass, Facade, Architecture, Display window, Urban area, Font, " width=1024 height=800 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Connected to the lobby of the dark and seductive <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.acehotel.com/newyork data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ace Hotel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ace Hotel</a> is a brightly lit Stumptown Coffee Roasters, which you can order from either their shop, or from the hotel lobby's communal workspace.

The to-stay cups here have fun sayings on the inside, reading "Good Luck" and "Fun Times" which is bound to put a smile on your face once you get to the bottom of your cup, and consider being sad that your delicious java experience is over. With that said, it doesn't have to be–this place serves delicious options to go along with takeaway cartons of cold brew.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/locations/newyork/ace-nyc data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stumptown Coffee Roasters @ Ace Hotel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Stumptown Coffee Roasters @ Ace Hotel</a>, 18 West 29th Street, New York, NY 10001</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Toby's Estate Coffee @ Club Monaco</h2><img alt="White, Interior design, Building, Room, Property, Furniture, Ceiling, Home, House, Design, " data-cy=slide-image-17 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-coffee-tobys-estate-1496702773.jpg title="White, Interior design, Building, Room, Property, Furniture, Ceiling, Home, House, Design, " width=3000 height=2002 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Refuel at this six seat espresso bar inside of the Club Monaco's flagship store after a Fifth Avenue shopping spree.

Food wise, the almond butter cookies or chia seed pudding here are a must.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For locations, visit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.brooklyndiamondcoffee.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=brooklyndiamondcoffee.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">brooklyndiamondcoffee.com</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/477d0992-dfa2-4eb1-a7ad-003cf602ca1c_1519710927.jpg alt="Headshot of Natasha Huang Smith" title="Headshot of Natasha Huang Smith" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Natasha Huang is a former fashion publicist turned consultant and travel writer.
