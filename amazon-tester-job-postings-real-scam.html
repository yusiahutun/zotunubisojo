Have you seen a social media advertisement announcing this job opening or a video promoting it? Although this job exists, it isn't offered directly by Amazon but by third-party affiliates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since it is not a formal job offered by Amazon, scammers often create and advertise fake job listings about this role, get people to apply, and subsequently steal their personal information. How does this role work? How can you tell if a job advert is real or fake?</p><h2 id=what-is-an-amazon-product-tester>What Is an Amazon Product Tester?</h2><p>Although the job title, Amazon Product Tester, indicates that the position is offered directly by Amazon, this is not the case. Amazon does have a giveaway program called the Amazon Vine Program, which lets selective shoppers review Amazon products and share their honest feedback. Since it is mostly unpaid, it doesn't qualify as a full-time job.</p><p>Instead, it's a part-time gig geared towards Amazon shoppers who regularly purchase from the retailer, share their honest opinions, and assist other shoppers in making well-informed purchases. This giveaway program is also an invitation-only initiative, meaning Amazon hires reviewers based on their Amazon review rank. It is not open to everyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/amazon-vine-program.jpg><p>Besides <a href=#>joining the Amazon Vine program</a>, some affiliates and third-party companies partner with legitimate Amazon sellers and give carefully chosen individuals the opportunity to review high-end quality products listed on Amazon. Companies like these help Amazon sellers get more reviews for their listings to kick-start their product launches or improve their rankings.</p><p>These companies work with two categories of individuals: high-profile influencers and content creators whose content is viewed by thousands of people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's how the review process goes: A third-party company offers influencers and creators the opportunity to join their network and test the Amazon product that best suits their audience. Once an agreement has been reached, such platforms or sellers themselves send the product to influencers. Reviewers test products, provide honest feedback on Amazon, and promote it to their audience.</p><p>The use of influencer marketing gives sellers a massive direct reach to thousands of people. Consequently, they generate huge sales immediately after launch and enjoy tremendous organic growth on Amazon. In exchange, the sellers let the influencer or content creator keep the product and, most of the time, pay healthy compensation.</p><h2 id=how-to-become-an-amazon-product-tester>How to Become an Amazon Product Tester</h2><p>The Amazon Product Tester role is primarily aimed at regular Amazon shoppers and people with a good fan following. Usually, these are invite-only opportunities, meaning Amazon or companies directly approach creators or reviewers. Therefore, not everyone can join. If you're a famous influencer, stay in the spotlight, and such a company will most likely contact you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you find such a website, check its authenticity before applying. Do not share sensitive information with such sites or end up paying to review the product instead of getting paid.</p><p>Amazon sellers often use Facebook groups to hunt for genuine reviewers or influencers to market and review their products. But you should avoid joining such groups since you can never be sure who you're dealing with.</p><p>Also, depending on where you live, the practice of exchanging free products or payments for favorable reviews without a disclosure could be illegal.</p><h2 id=how-to-spot-a-fake-amazon-tester-job-listing>How to Spot a Fake Amazon Tester Job Listing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/a-fake-amazon-product-tester-job-on-a-scam-website.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Amazon Tester positions are invite-only and rarely announced, scammers take advantage of this by creating fake job listings and tricking people into filling out applications. The would-be victims who fall prey to scam job posts unwittingly share their personal information. This becomes data that scammers later misuse.</p><p>Sometimes, the scammers pretend to be from a company and approach influencers with the intent of hacking their accounts. Therefore, you must verify whether a job offer you receive or see in an advertisement is legitimate.</p><p>If you see an advertisement for such a job on a website, a simple web search will tell you whether the website is legitimate. If you don't find any information about the website, check how old it is, find reviews about it, and look for <a href=#>other signs that indicate the webpage is untrustworthy</a>. Also, if the application form on the website asks for sensitive information, it's most likely a scam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are a content creator or influencer with a massive following and receive a link about joining such a role, do not click it right away. Instead, find out who sent the message. Most trusted companies reach out to influencers through their official accounts, so be cautious if you receive this offer from a random user.</p><p>Basicstester.com and Basicsprogram.com are scam websites that promote fake Amazon Tester job listings across social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit. Websites like these only steal people's information and then use it to scam them. Don't apply for any job offer you see on these sites.</p><h2 id=got-swindled-by-a-fake-amazon-tester-job-offer>Got Swindled by a Fake Amazon Tester Job Offer?</h2><p>In case you've already applied to a fake job offer using your personal information, you can't go back and discard it. However, you can avoid further damage by freezing your bank accounts and credit cards, informing the authorities about the leak, and <a href=#>staying vigilant against phishing emails</a> and phone calls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If your social media account has been hacked, you should try to recover it as soon as possible. Whether you need to <a href=#>recover your account on Facebook</a>, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, or any other social media platform, you must act quickly and seek professional assistance if necessary. This will prevent scammers from exploiting your reputation and tricking your followers.</p><h2 id=beware-of-amazon-tester-job-scams>Beware of Amazon Tester Job Scams</h2><p>Generally speaking, people offering jobs as Amazon Product Testers are side hustlers, not legitimate Amazon employees. That said, this is an actual job position, one that is invite-only.</p><p>With better understanding of how people come across this role, you're less likely to fall victim to fraud. Make sure to verify whether a job listing is legitimate. Beware of this scam and inform others, so they can stay safe too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYppmqpLtuwMSsq56qXZ%2B8o3nPqKqtoZ6cwG6%2BxJqjZquTlrpw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./arkansas-cop-31-arrested-child-trafficking-sting-texas-saying-likes-officer-young-people-come-talk-to-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arkansas cop, 31, arrested in child trafficking sting in Texas after trying to have sex with an unde">&larr;
