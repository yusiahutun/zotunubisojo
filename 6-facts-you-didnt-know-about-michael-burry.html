This fund had a successful run from the year of its foundation in 2000 till 2008 before he closed it down to focus on his personal investments. He is also known for being among the first investors to foresee and profit from the subprime mortgage crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2010.</p><p>If you still have a little knowledge about Michael Burry, here is a film you might be interested in The Big Short. Played by our beloved Batman, Christian Bale, the film is about the <a href=# rel=noopener>life of Michael Burry</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So who is this crazy person who vibes to heavy metal music, works barefoot, and has trouble making eye contact with people?&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few facts you probably didn’t know about your investment guru, Michael Burry.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=1-he-has-a-glass-eye>1. He has a glass eye-</h3><p>Because of a rare form of cancer, <strong>he had to get his left eye removed before the age of two</strong>. After a certain age, he has been donning a glass eye, which has made it difficult for him to make proper eye contact with people. But that might not be the exact reason for it!&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=2-his-asperger-s-disease>2. His Asperger’s Disease-</h3><p>Pretty later in his life, Michael realized the real reason for his socially awkward behavior was Asperger’s Syndrome. He only realized this after a child psychiatrist said that his child had the syndrome. In the movie The Big Short, it is not explicitly shown that Burry has Asperger’s Syndrome, but Bale does execute his social interactions with precise awkwardness.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=3-he-was-studying-to-be-a-doctor>3. He was studying to be a doctor-</h3><p>Like the smart high-schoolers who opt for more advanced areas of study, Burry too went with medical studies. Although, medical school was like a breeze for Michael Burry. He was never interested in practicing medicine after he completed his studies. By 1998, he was more interested in posting his blog on investing than being a neurology resident at the Stanford Hospital. However, in a couple of years, he quit neurology and decided to become a full-time money manager.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=4-he-started-his-own-hedge-fund>4. He started his own hedge fund-</h3><p>Inspired by the book, The Scions of Shannara, Michael Burry opened the Scion Capital in the year 2000, under which he began managing a sum roughly around $1 million. By the year 2004, he had grown that amount to $600 million.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=5-he-rightly-predicted-the-housing-crisis-helping-his-investors-to-make-millions>5. He rightly predicted the housing crisis, helping his investors to make millions-</h3><p>By predicting the housing crisis, Burry used a billion dollars of his investors’ money in credit-default swaps on sub-prime mortgage bonds. Burry placed a bet against the housing market. His predictions were so right that he won about $100 million for himself and about $725 million for his investors.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=6-his-fascination-for-the-stock-market-started-very-early-in-his-life>6. His fascination for the stock market started very early in his life-</h3><p>If you think that Michael Burry was interested in the <a href=#>stock market</a> during his medical school, or later in his high school years. But in fact, Burry learned about the stock market approximately in around his second grade. He researched deep into American Motors, the real company of the toy jeep he was playing with. By the time Burry was in high school, he was investing real money in the stock market.&nbsp;</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>More From The Enterprise World</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/article-2-1024x683.jpg><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-color">Michael Burry: A Probability of Collapse In 2022?</h2><p class=has-text-color>Not many people believed Michael initially, however, he is known to have a lot of say as to how the market will move over in the coming years.
