No one knew that better than the women whom Biggie was romantically involved with in his life, including the mother of his daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Biggie-in-hat.jpg><h2 id=h-the-notorious-b-i-g-s-baby-mother-jan-jackson>The Notorious B.I.G.’s baby mother, Jan Jackson</h2><p id=par-2_43>The Notorious B.I.G. dated a woman Jan Jackson from his neighborhood in Brooklyn when they were in high school. They dated on and off for years afterward, and at the outset of his career, she became pregnant with their daughter, T’yanna Wallace.</p><p id=par-3_43>Jackson has kept a low profile throughout the years and only spoken publicly a handful of times. In a 2004 interview with <a href=#>XXL</a> magazine, Jackson opened up about dating and having a child with one of the greatest rappers to ever live.</p><p id=par-4_34>“He brought out&nbsp;the&nbsp;best&nbsp;in&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;knew that anything&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to&nbsp;accomplish, he would&nbsp;back&nbsp;me&nbsp;up on it,” she said honestly. “I miss that he was my&nbsp;fall guy.&nbsp;I knew if everything&nbsp;in&nbsp;my life was&nbsp;going wrong,&nbsp;he&nbsp;would do anything. I&nbsp;would&nbsp;call&nbsp;and he would do&nbsp;everything&nbsp;he&nbsp;could to make&nbsp;it&nbsp;right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Biggie-with-friends.jpg><h2 id=h-jan-jackson-said-the-notorious-b-i-g-only-dated-light-skinned-girls>Jan Jackson said The Notorious B.I.G. only dated light-skinned girls</h2><p id=par-5_41>Jackson also spoke frankly about how Biggie garnered a reputation as a playboy after his rap career blew up. He married Faith Evans just three months after they broke up, after they had only known each other for eight days.</p><p id=par-6_77>“I was shocked when he got married.&nbsp;Up until that point, I still had hope alive. He was still&nbsp;coming&nbsp;to see me, we were still&nbsp;interacting with each other. I really thought I was going along for the ride.&nbsp;We were such kindred spirits,” she recalled. “I had this impression that nothing would come between us, but I guess rap came between&nbsp;us.&nbsp;Maybe it was,&nbsp;‘I’m&nbsp;a rapper&nbsp;now and I can have anyone I want to and I’m gonna take advantage of it.'”</p><p id=par-7_58>XXL then noted that seemingly all the women he was with after they had broken up were much lighter-skinned than she was. When asked if she believed he was “color-struck” and preferred lighter-skinned women, she was frank with her answer: “Probably. Because I&nbsp;see&nbsp;the same thing everyone else sees: after me I never saw him with another dark-skinned woman.”</p><p id=par-8_20>“That’s where&nbsp;the&nbsp;animosity came in, like,&nbsp;‘These people are gonna dog the s— out of you and you’re gonna&nbsp;see&nbsp;who really loved you.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Biggie-wearing-orange.jpg><h2 id=h-jan-jackson-loved-the-notorious-b-i-g>Jan Jackson loved The Notorious B.I.G.</h2><p id=par-9_40>Still, despite their relationship falling apart, Jackson has always had love for Biggie and is grateful to have been a part of his life. “I did not know what love&nbsp;was&nbsp;before&nbsp;I met him. I thought I did,&nbsp;but I didn’t,” she admitted.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_51>When asked if she believed she was his first love, she left it up to readers to decide. “I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;say [if I was his first love], because that man loved&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot.&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t wanna toot my own horn,&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;somebody&nbsp;else will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the magazine&nbsp;saying, ‘I&nbsp;was his first love!'” she said. “But I will&nbsp;say&nbsp;I do&nbsp;believe&nbsp;he loved me. I will&nbsp;say&nbsp;that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7sMDOq6CoraNir6qzjJuYm7Fdory1tMSrZKyZmZl6qbGMoZidZZFisKa%2B05qgp2Wkrr2medahnKdlmal6pK3MnmStp12ZrrW1zaBloaydoXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./faye-chrisley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Faye Chrisley">&larr;
