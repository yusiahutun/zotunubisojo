However, there are heavy punishments for people who provide abortions. For example, in the state of Louisiana, illegal abortion providers could be punished with up to 15 years in prison and receive a hefty fine.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Nevertheless, there are still “abortion abolitionists”, such as pastor Jeff Durbin of the Apologia Church. Durbin recently pushed for a bill in Louisiana that would criminalise women who receive the procedure and treat it the same as homicide. Although his attempt failed, people like Durbin have had their voices amplified since Roe v.
