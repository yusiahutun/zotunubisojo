And he’s proven he still has what it takes to be a serious competitor after all these years. So, how old is Darrell in 2021? And when did he first start <a href=#>competing on The Challenge</a>? Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-darrell-taylor-when-did-he-start-mtv-reality-tv>How old is Darrell Taylor? When did he start MTV reality TV?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Challenge-3.jpg><p id=par-2_67>Darrell is 41 years old, and he was born on Nov. 5, 1979. In 2021, he’ll be 42 — but that likely won’t stop him from competing on MTV’s The Challenge. Not only does he continue to be a physical force on the show, but he’ll be participating in <a href=#>The Challenge: All Stars</a> next, where he’ll compete against the best of the best for the ultimate title.</p><p id=par-3_44>So, when did Darrell start his MTV career? According to The Challenge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wiki</a>, he began reality TV with Road Rules: Campus Crawl. It was MTV’s 11th season of Road Rules, and it premiered in 2002. At the time, Darrell was just 23 years old.</p><p id=par-4_43>After Campus Crawl, Darrell went right into The Challenge. While many just see him as a physical threat, he proved he can also solve puzzles in Double Agents, as he took out the puzzle master himself, Devin Walker, during an elimination challenge.</p><h2 id=h-when-did-darrell-win-the-challenge>When did Darrell win ‘The Challenge’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_39>So, has Darrell won MTV’s The Challenge? He certainly has. Right after his debut on Road Rules, Darrell competed in The Gauntlet and won. He’s also won The Inferno, The Inferno II, Fresh Meat, and Champs vs. Pros.</p><p id=par-6_51>While the competitor had a ton of early luck when competing on the show, his luck seemed to run out by 2017. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> notes he was eliminated early in XXX: Dirty 30. And Double Agents was his first time back in the game for a full season in years.</p><p id=par-7_63>“[MTV] always called me and would then say, ‘Sorry, we’re not going to go that route,'” Darrell explained. “Which was fine, it never really bothered me too much. I guess they just pulled the trigger this year, and it was perfect timing. I just closed my gym and then I could go do&nbsp;The Challenge&nbsp;and get paid to try to win some more money.”</p><p id=par-8_38>Despite all of his experience, Darrell knows he has some weak points. “Everybody’s built different, and I’m more final-built,” he added. “And maybe eliminations. I’m not really too good at the daily challenges unless they’re on the ground.”</p><h2 id=h-is-darrell-from-the-challenge-married>Is Darrell from ‘The Challenge’ married?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_37>Outside of MTV’s The Challenge, what is Darrell’s home life like? It turns out he’s married with kids. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heavy</a>, Darrell married Milasent Hernandez back in 2017, and they have a son and a daughter together.</p><p id=par-10_55>While Darrell and Milasent have only been married a few years, they’ve reportedly been together a lot longer. The publication notes the couple’s been together since at least 2007. As for what Milasent does for a living, she’s a certified registered nurse anesthetist. The couple also works together in their gym where they personally train.</p><p id=par-11_30>We’re excited to see Darrell continue to participate in The Challenge, as he’s lined up to star in All Stars streaming on Paramount+. All Stars premieres on April 1.</p><p id=par-12_7>Check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMnJ%2BapJyau6ixjKGmsGWfobFusMCrqZ6knGLBosXLqKlmr5iau260xGaqrZmiqXq0tM6wZaGsnaF8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./it-was-like-her-soul-was-crying-out-for-something.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="It was like her soul was crying out for something | Free News">&larr;
