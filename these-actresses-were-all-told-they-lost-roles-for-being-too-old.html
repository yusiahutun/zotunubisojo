At one point, she was rejected from a role because she was "too old" to play a male actor's love interest, even though she was 20 years younger than him.</p><p>"A certain male actor that was making a movie said that I was too old to be his romantic interest, and I was 20 years younger than him," Geena told <a href=#>Deadline</a>. "Women peak in their 20s and 30s, and men peak in their 40s and 50s as far as actors go. So the male stars of the movies want to appear to be younger than they are, or they want to appeal to younger people, so they always want a co-star who is really young. That is why that happens and that is why women don't get cast very much after 40 and 50. It is because they are felt to be too old to be a romantic interest."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2a910496-c791-4748-97e5-6aa0424736dc data-container-ref=toofab:article:2b740fd8-0200-4178-9bdb-4f3b921cf21f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a0/5by4/2023/01/12/a06a7b83e1a04f20b3fe1261a6391e30_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Geena Davis Gets Choked Up Detailing How Bill Murray Allegedly Berated Her on Film Set</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>8.</strong><a href=#><strong> Nia Long</strong></a></p><p>In the early 2000s, Nia Long auditioned for a part in "Charlie's Angels" but was told she wasn't the right fit.
