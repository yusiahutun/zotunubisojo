Among the cast that most entertained the fans was Jeremiah Buoni. So, let’s learn what’s new with him? And what has changed for him so far as of this writing?</p><p>Delve into this article about Jeremiah Buoni where we discuss his age, height, net worth, and his family members. Of course, we won’t be missing his relationship status and relationship with Gus Smyrnios.</p><h3><strong>Jeremiah Buoni Age</strong></h3><p>Jeremiah Buoni turned 26 years in 2021. He celebrated his birthday on 15 March.</p><h3><strong>Jeremiah Buoni Height</strong></h3><p>Along with a buffy physique, Jeremiah Buoni’s height of 6 feet 1 inch makes him look even more formidable.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Jeremiah Buoni Brothers?</strong></h3><p>Jeremiah Buoni is one of the fours sons born to his former-stripper father Joseph Buoni Jr and his mother Debbie Buoni whose details are not widely known. While sharing about his father’s days as a stripper on his Twitter account one user replied, “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Your parents were adorable! Your dad absentmindedly rubbing your mom’s leg while you guys were talking was precious. Also, how the hell did they go from people in strip clubs to conservative homeschooling parents?!”</span></p><p>A self-proclaimed momma’s boy, Jeremiah wrote on Instagram in January 2020, “Safe to say I love my Mom!❤️ Who’s ready to meet the Buoni’s tonight on our parents’ day special?! Tune in tonight and enjoy this awesome day with us @floribamashore&nbsp; #parentsday&nbsp; #mommasboy #familytime #mtvfloribamashore”</p><p>Speaking of Jeremiah’s brothers, he has three. Joshua Buoni is a Floribama cast, and two young brothers named <a href=#>Josiah Buoni</a> and Jesse Buoni. His socials revealed that he is very close to all of them. Josiah and Jesse often appear on Jeremiah’s Instagram.</p><p>Talking about Joshua, he served as the CEO of FitStrong Nutrition. He started serving in the position in March of 2017. The company is based in Glendale, Arizona, and was founded in 2014. Before that, Josh served in the military.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Jeremiah Buoni Sister?</strong></h3><p>Jeremiah Buoni and his three brothers also have a sister whose name is Moriah Buoni according to an online source. The second post that he ever made on Instagram was his sister. In the photo, Jeremiah’s sister was holding him in her arms. He wrote, “Stronger than she looks”</p><p>In another pic from October 2014, he <a href=#>wrote</a>, “Poker night antics with my sis!:) #LoveMySis#Poker#Bandana” Compared to his two brothers, his sister is relatively private.</p><h3><strong>Jeremiah Buoni Net Worth</strong></h3><p>According to The Sun, Jeremiah Buoni has a total net worth of $100 thousand.</p><p>Based on Jeremiah’s Facebook, he worked as a bartender at The Lobby Bar in Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island. But besides that, he seems all focused on fitness for a very long time. He is a gym rat obsessed with body and workout. A lot of his social media post is related to fitness and working out.</p><p>His IG bio stated that he is a <a href=#>FitStrong Supplements</a> athlete which was founded in 2014 by his brother Joshua.</p><p>But more importantly, Jeremiah is a reality star who appeared on MTV’s “Floribama Shore” (2017-2020). According to Cinemaholic, Jeremiah pockets $20,000 per season for the show.</p><h3><strong>Jeremiah Buoni Dating History</strong></h3><p>In season 3 of Floribama, Jeremiah Buoni was in a relationship with temporary cast member Mattie Lynx Breaux. Mattie was a friend of Gus who met up with him when the show was in St. Petersburg, which is where she met Jeremiah.</p><p>At a 4th of July party at the beach house, they were seen canoodling in the pool after Mattie takes a few body shots off Jeremiah. They were shown especially cozy as compared to their previous scenes together.</p><p>No doubt two of them had formed a connection with each other. To Mattie, it was a surprise because she never expected to have a connection with anyone on the show. But the season ended on 20th January 2020 and they don’t appear on each other’s socials. So, we can safely assume that they are not in a relationship with each other.</p><p>Plus in 2020, Mattie announced on her Twitter that she was single, so there’s that.</p><p>Yet again sometime in April 2020, Mattie had talked of her good times with Jeremiah. She said: <span>“I’ve been single for so long I didn’t even know I had that … I’m open to new relationships and pretty much a go-with-the-flow kind of gal. That kind of caught me off-guard, but I went in with an open mind and had some fun.”</span></p><p>When the fourth installment of the premiered Jeremiah appeared single. But, his fans are rooting for him to spark romance with <a href=#>Bethaney Goodloe</a>, best friend of Candace.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Floribama Shore:&nbsp;Are Gus Smyrnios&nbsp;and Jeremiah Buoni Friends?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Gus Smyrnios and Jeremiah Buoni were more than friends, they were best friends or even bros in the first two seasons of Floribama. However, their relationship fell apart in season 3 and season 4 of the show. In the sneak peek of the new season, Nilsa Prowant talked with Jeremiah about where he stands with his Gus.</p><p>She asked, “Have you and Gus been talking at all or just co-existing?” “Co-existing is the proper term for that,” replied Jeremiah to the question. Then Nilsa stopped beating around the bush and asked if he was going to be friends with Gus, Jeremiah shook his head and replied no.</p><p>“As I said, at this point, it’s too late. I’m sorry.” Jeremiah concluded.</p><p>In confessional, Jeremiah added, “I’m honestly over the conversation about whether I and Gus will be friends again. It makes me frustrated that people keep asking me. That’s all there is to know.” To know more about their drama, <a href=#>check here</a>.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Jeremiah Buoni On Twitter, TikTok?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jeremiah Buoni is on Twitter (@JeremiahBuoni) with 67.6k followers.
