Then perhaps you envision the feathered 17th-century cap and the rapier. James McAvoy, starring in an updated version of Edmond Rostand’s play about the legendary French raconteur, has none of those things — just his native Scottish accent, a buzz cut, and a smoldering glare. Director Jamie Lloyd, famous for paring back the classics (especially Pinter) on the West End, reconceptualized <a href=#>Cyrano</a> in an attempt to see how far he could push an audience to look past the stodgy, expected trappings of a period drama in verse and focus on the language itself. (A recent musical film starring <a href=#>Peter Dinklage</a> and <a href=#>his stage performance</a> did away with the schnoz too but kept a sumptuous period setting.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl1uz77fn001j3f6q2cx189p1@published data-word-count=93>Lloyd’s Cyrano first played the West End in 2019 and received rave reviews celebrating the dexterity of Martin Crimp’s modern translation, which brings elements of slam poetry and rap to Rostand’s verse, and McAvoy’s baldly emotional performance. One long pandemic delay and a repeat run in London (plus a Glasgow stop) later, Cyrano has made it to America. “I’m not Cyrano, but the way I’m playing Cyrano is like me if I was really fucking angry and lonely and insecure about the way I look,” McAvoy tells me the afternoon following opening night.</p>Feeling Out the Space<p>The day starts in rehearsal with Jamie Lloyd, James McAvoy, and the cast adjusting to BAM Harvey Theater’s wider stage, mapping how much to spread themselves out to accommodate it. “This theater’s got its own vibe,” McAvoy says. “The silences in it are incredible.”</p>“We’ve done this in four theaters, and every one’s given us a slightly different relationship with the audience.”<p>From left: Evelyn Miller (Roxane), McAvoy, and Michele Austin (Ragueneau).</p>Re-fueling<p>Midway through the day, McAvoy scarfs down some roast chicken and fries from Chicken Stop down the street, “which I quite like.” It’s a hasty affair.&nbsp;“I like to eat my dinner real quick” after rehearsal, he says, to leave time to get in some rest and recovery before prepping for the show.&nbsp;</p><p>In this adaptation, Cyrano’s characters wear modern dress as its actors would. “The boots in the show are my boots,” McAvoy says, as is the shirt he “lived in” for a while.</p>At Ease<p>“The way Jamie likes to rehearse, it’s like we’re doing the play all day long.” So to avoid total exhaustion, McAvoy settles down on a cot, appropriate for a military character, in his dressing room for a little shut-eye.</p>“I try to get a half-hour to 45 minutes of sleep before we warm up.” Center Stage<p>Much of Cyrano’s rehearsals have focused on the specifics of the show’s intricate blocking. “The way Jaime directs is so precise that if anybody moves out of time, it draws focus away from where the audience is meant to be looking.”</p>Brains and Brawn<p>McAvoy claims he hadn’t worked out in the seven months before revisiting Cyrano and has made getting back into shape part of his theater routine. “I’m quite short and stocky, and when I start to work out, I get like a tank, and that’s how I want to play him — like a tank.”</p>“Part of my warm-up will be a bodyweight routine, but the theater got me weights, and now we do pull-ups as well.” Vibe Check<p>While working out and prepping for the show, McAvoy has “a little playlist going on” that helps him channel Cyrano’s braggadocio. “I listen to the Arctic Monkeys, I listen to a lot of Macklemore, and I listen to Black Keys and the Streets, like, from a long time ago.”</p>Sports!<p>Cyrano depends on characters interrupting one another’s verse, so to get everyone in sync, the cast plays a game: Keep a ball in the air until everyone has touched it and then toss it in a bucket, if there is one.
